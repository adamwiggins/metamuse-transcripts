00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>I think the process is just inherently much messier than that.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.590
And you need to let go a little bit and say,

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.980
the tool is going to help you make this stew and then you'll sleep on it for a

4
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:10.290
few days. And then somewhere else, something new will pop out.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.460
Hello and welcome to Metamuse.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.390
Muse is software for your iPad that helps you with ideation and problem-solving.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.500
But this podcast isn't about Muse the product it's about Muse, the company,

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.260
and the small team behind it. I'm Mark McGranaghan.

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.870
And I'm here today with my colleague, Adam Wiggins. How's it going, Adam?

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.390
<v 1>Going pretty good, Mark. I just got back from a short trip up to the Baltic sea,</v>

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.270
which is a pretty easy train ride from where I live in Berlin.

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.520
This is the first real trip I've taken since I guess pandemic started so about

13
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.720
six, six, seven months.

14
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.560
And it was really refreshing even though it was just a couple days.

15
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.670
And I was reminded of something you said when we, uh,

16
00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:55.490
I think it was in our very second episode of the podcast about having good

17
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:56.324
ideas,

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.430
which is how fresh surroundings refresh your brain creatively. And yeah,

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380
I had that there and it was really,

20
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.370
it was really that came to mind because I was really reminded of how much I,

21
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.240
I missed that in this time where travel is not a part of our lives,

22
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:12.074
the way it used to be.

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.680
<v 0>Yeah. I'm always surprised by how powerful that effect is.</v>

24
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.600
So today our topic is tools for thought. Now, Adam, what does that mean for you?

25
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.270
<v 1>Tools for thought means a lot of things to me,</v>

26
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:27.530
but I think the first place my head goes to is Howard Rheingold's classic book

27
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.360
from, I think it was the eighties where he details Xerox PARC and

28
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.170
many of these visionary folks who are thinking about computing and it's early

29
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:40.730
days and what that could do for humans and our creative and productive

30
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:41.564
lives.

31
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.900
But I actually stepped back even a little bit from there because the original

32
00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:48.770
tools for thought I feel like are anything that lets you externalize your

33
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:53.330
thoughts. And so pen and paper, you know, writing language, uh,

34
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.810
is the starting place there. The printing press, maybe, uh,

35
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.170
but more in modern times, things like sketchbooks or I don't know,

36
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:01.100
in a startup office,

37
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:05.990
you've got whiteboards and a school you've got chalkboards post-it notes are a

38
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.520
great tool for thought fact,

39
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:11.060
because you can write down these little snippets of information and move them

40
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.480
around, maybe in a physical space with colleagues. Um,

41
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.180
there's even something like I remembered a team summit.

42
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:21.260
We had a few years back might've been even been there in the park in Seattle.

43
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.160
You wanted to illustrate a point and ended up grabbing a stick and basically

44
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:28.880
drawing a very simple diagram in the dirt. Right?

45
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.870
So anything that lets you really either make visual or somehow

46
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.760
externalize what's in your mind, I think is, is a type of tool for thought.

47
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.810
And that also includes, I think the, call it, the consumption side,

48
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:45.020
which is what I usually call active reading.

49
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.660
So book and a highlighter together,

50
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.280
I think is a type of tool for thought the act of

51
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.600
highlighting passages that you find impactful or relevant to what you're trying

52
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:58.460
to learn about makes this,

53
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.040
learning this reading process into an active process and a learning one.

54
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.740
And that, that becomes a tool for thought as well.

55
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.511
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:10.140
And I'm sure we'll dive into a lot of different kind of specific instantiations

57
00:03:10.141 --> 00:03:11.220
of tools for thought.

58
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.130
But another way to think about this is what is the problem you're trying to

59
00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:16.680
solve here? Two possibilities. One would be,

60
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.030
you're trying to obtain the knowledge that has already been generated by someone

61
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:24.000
else. You're trying to learn some facts, memorize some figures,

62
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.960
maybe retain some ideas and different tools for thought can help you with that.

63
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.060
Another angle would be, you're trying to generate new ideas, novel thoughts,

64
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.300
and a tool might help you accomplish that as well.

65
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.480
And I think actually which one you're trying to do is quite important for which

66
00:03:39.481 --> 00:03:40.314
tool you choose.

67
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.681
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:44.760
Another reference I was looking up in prep for this episode was Andy mapped

69
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.800
checks work and he's got a,

70
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.100
a piece called how do we develop transformative tools for thought?

71
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.230
And his work has current research track is more on that learning retaining

72
00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:57.810
side of things, these pneumonic devices and so on.

73
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.100
This is a nice article I'll link into the show notes because he does on the

74
00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:04.860
later part of the article, he describes a lot of this history,

75
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.180
particularly around the computing tools for thought Steve jobs and the bicycle

76
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:13.860
for the mind. Uh, he talks about that. He thinks quoting Alan Kay who's,

77
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.760
who's one of the, sort of the big visionaries in this world, uh,

78
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.780
as saying that actually medium for thought in some cases might be a better,

79
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.090
better preterm, but for whatever reason, the, uh,

80
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.830
the tools for thought seems to be the label that, that stock. So Andy's work,

81
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:31.380
I think is a good example of the, how do you,

82
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:34.950
how do you get more out of what you're trying to learn about?

83
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.450
And then there's the having ideas or generating new thoughts or generating

84
00:04:39.451 --> 00:04:42.600
original ideas, which is obviously the space muse is trying to play in.

85
00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:46.230
Or at least we're trying to create a tool that can help the end user to have

86
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:49.020
better ideas to develop their ideas. So, yeah,

87
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.330
coming back to the digital space,

88
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.230
the tools for thought book spends time on, for example,

89
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:59.310
the Xerox park lab that invented a lot of the modern gooey operating system and

90
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:02.610
other things that we sort of take for granted in the modern computing world.

91
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.920
There's also folks like Doug Engelbart and his vision to augment human intellect

92
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.480
as people like Alan Kay,

93
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:13.470
who invented small talk and object oriented programming had this vision for a

94
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:16.650
thing called the Dynabook that I guess you could say physically looked a lot

95
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:17.850
like an iPad looks today,

96
00:05:17.851 --> 00:05:22.410
but was more focused on the creative and productive uses of computing

97
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.570
and there's even stuff like of,

98
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.100
or folks like the neevr Bush who wrote an essay that people still quote today

99
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:33.180
from the 1940s about this thing called the Memex or this vision he had for a

100
00:05:33.181 --> 00:05:34.230
thing called the Memex.

101
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.830
And I think one thing you get when people talk about these, uh,

102
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.930
the anger of arts and Ks and bushes,

103
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.210
they're often sort of lamenting a future that maybe we were dreaming

104
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.530
of in these times,

105
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:50.820
that then you look at today's computing and for all the really impressive

106
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:55.620
technology that we have and all the things that computers and software and the

107
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:56.940
internet can do for us.

108
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.910
In some ways we didn't really fulfill some of the beautiful vision that these

109
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:06.080
folks had. In fact, I think some of those folks were even in some ways,

110
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.110
a bit bitter, you know, towards the end of their careers,

111
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:12.050
when they see all these startups and whatever,

112
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:16.610
putting all this money into these shiny products that in fact are more kind of

113
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.110
entertainment boxes,

114
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:22.550
rather than something designed to really elevate the human race.

115
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.580
<v 0>Yeah. And Andy makes a point in his,</v>

116
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.650
in his article that there are good economic reasons why that's the case or why

117
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.720
we would expect that to be the case, uh,

118
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.010
essentially because new ideas and tools for thought are sort of public good.

119
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.430
So it's hard to capture economic value when you make innovations in that space.

120
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.200
Um, but we still think it's possible, uh,

121
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.840
both to have new ideas here and to build a business around it.

122
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.520
<v 1>If we fast forward a little bit from the Halcyon days of these,</v>

123
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.880
these computing visionaries in the sixties, seventies and eighties,

124
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.050
a little bit more to when personal computing became commonplace,

125
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.900
maybe the 1990s. And I think what you see is when you,

126
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.250
or at least when I think of productivity software really broadly speaking,

127
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.270
I tend to think of offering what I usually call offering applications.

128
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.090
This is something like use illustrator.

129
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.680
If you're a designer or use Microsoft word, if you're a writer or use Excel,

130
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:19.510
if you're a financial analyst, these are really designed for an end artifact,

131
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:23.290
you're producing something to be consumed by someone else when you type into

132
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.220
your word processor it's because eventually you want to publish that book or

133
00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:29.200
publish an article online.

134
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.520
I think folks often do use these offering tools for the thinking phase.

135
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.430
If you've ever opened your word processor or a programmer,

136
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:41.290
maybe uses a text editor or something like that to sketch down some ideas,

137
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.860
not with the intention of that's ever going to be given to someone else,

138
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:48.520
but to get your own your own head together, just because that's the tool,

139
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:52.660
you know how to use it's right there, but it's not really designed fat. In fact,

140
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.260
in a way it's a, it's a poor fit. You just happen to know about it.

141
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.470
And it seems from a really creative uses, uh, certainly on the,

142
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.800
for people that like laying things out visually and spatially, kind of like we,

143
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.640
we strive for, with muse. We've seen, for example, um,

144
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.650
we saw someone that did a masters,

145
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.080
did all their master's thesis research in illustrator.

146
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.780
Cause they wanted to lay out all these papers.

147
00:08:13.781 --> 00:08:17.080
They were reading and the excerpts they were taking from them and how they all

148
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:20.140
connect together. They want it on this big spatial canvas.

149
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.500
And it turns out that illustrator was the best choice for that at that time.

150
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.990
Maybe nowadays people do that with Figma, somewhat,

151
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.040
which I think is great that people are doing these innovative uses,

152
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:34.390
but that was part of what led to the impetus for us wanting to build a tool for

153
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:38.560
thought that was more something that's purpose built for enhancing the

154
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.190
individuals or even a group's thinking now in practice,

155
00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:45.520
because we've seen so few commercial tools for thought.

156
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.470
I wonder if that means that either people don't value that ideation step enough

157
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.460
to want to invest in that. So that's, you know, monetarily,

158
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.620
do they want to for software,

159
00:08:55.621 --> 00:09:00.540
but it's also just taking the time to learn a piece of software or to put your

160
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:04.440
data and your thoughts into a piece of software when that's not the end place

161
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.710
it's going to be. Um, so I think that's, that's certainly a, you know,

162
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:11.400
a risk or an open question for muse and really anyone else that's working on a,

163
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.960
uh, on a tool for thought.

164
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.430
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

165
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.690
I do think there's a commercial piece there where the obviously biggest market

166
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:21.050
is when you're close to the end product that you're producing for a business or

167
00:09:21.051 --> 00:09:24.140
you're producing a presentation and you're producing a book there's obvious

168
00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:25.940
economic value that you want to attach to that.

169
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.100
And there's a bunch of a bunch of people who obviously need to do that.

170
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.350
<v 1>Yeah. And I th I think that's most notable when you,</v>

171
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.540
when you try to sell software to professionals,

172
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.680
if you say one of the best pitches you can offer is this will make you look

173
00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:37.700
really good to your client.

174
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.030
You will close more deals or you will impress your boss,

175
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.030
or you will get that big, that big deal that you're trying to do.

176
00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:48.680
And so presentation software, or really good financial modeling, or,

177
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.550
you know, the word processor that's, that's the value there is,

178
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.630
is really clear to people.

179
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.170
If you say this will make your ideas better or make your decisions better,

180
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.950
for some reason that that's a less poignant sales pitch, I think, yeah.

181
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:05.030
<v 0>I keep coming back to this idea that there's an incomplete understanding of the</v>

182
00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:05.930
creative process.

183
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.790
We've long advocated for this three step process where you're one gathering

184
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.050
raw materials to actively reading processing, ruminating,

185
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:18.440
brainstorming on those materials and then three offering an end product.

186
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.220
I think a lot of people think of the creative process as one in three,

187
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.000
because there's obvious physical content that you're dealing with in each of

188
00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:29.060
those cases. Like you have to pull in some raw material to like,

189
00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:32.450
say it in your paper and you have to produce a paper at the end to send to the

190
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:36.220
publisher, but you can kind of get away without doing the middle step without,

191
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.810
you know, thinking, um, or you can just do it all in your head.

192
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.170
But the premise with muse is that there's a,

193
00:10:41.171 --> 00:10:44.840
a very powerful and important second step there that with the right tooling

194
00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:46.970
support can give you even more power as a thinker.

195
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.350
<v 1>One place, the tools for thought has come back into the current conversation,</v>

196
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.570
uh, is the product roam research.

197
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.430
Who's been getting a lot of traction among people who I think like to think

198
00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:01.670
deeply, particularly built around a daily journaling practice,

199
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:06.470
which I think is a really a good way to get your thoughts out in a freeform

200
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.790
way. Uh,

201
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:10.940
one of the things I remember them complaining about that's the right way to put

202
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:13.430
it is being trapped in this category of note.

203
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:17.150
Taking note taking is an interesting category because it seems to span a lot of

204
00:11:17.151 --> 00:11:19.130
things. You've got a classic like Evernote,

205
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.670
which in theory should be kind of a tool for thought it's supposed to be sort of

206
00:11:22.671 --> 00:11:26.030
a second brain. You put stuff into it, you can find it later,

207
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:29.510
but the reality is it doesn't necessarily help you find connections.

208
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.300
I think it sort of failed to deliver on that promise.

209
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.530
It's maybe more of a knowledge base or knowledge store. I use Dropbox for that,

210
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.200
for example. And I think that's true for a lot of notes, apps,

211
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:42.890
things we've talked about here before something like a bear, for example,

212
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.990
it's a really nice way to quickly capture a thought, you know,

213
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:47.840
on your smartphone and then you have access to later,

214
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.190
but it's not really a place to do a lot of deep ideation. I don't know.

215
00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:55.570
Maybe you sketch down a few thoughts you have in bullet point form,

216
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:59.380
but it's not a good place for really freeform ideation.

217
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.670
And maybe that's a place where Rome is helping change things a little bit. Uh,

218
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.650
I also see this tool for thought, uh,

219
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.730
sometimes applied to some other hot new products, which include notion,

220
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
which is more of a team Wiki team, brain kind of thing.

221
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.480
But I think it can fit with that as well. Figma, as previously mentioned,

222
00:12:16.481 --> 00:12:18.940
sometimes people use it as this kind of visual canvas,

223
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.420
even something like air table, which is a spreadsheet, but often again,

224
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:25.750
people use it in these team context to capture knowledge, uh,

225
00:12:25.751 --> 00:12:29.940
and to basically find shared understanding on the team it's not intended for.

226
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.260
There's no end artifact for the client. Uh,

227
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:37.240
it's more internal to what the team's own sense of understanding of problem

228
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:38.074
space.

229
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.200
<v 0>Now what's interesting to me is why are tools like this useful tools for</v>

230
00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:46.740
thought? I think some people would say it's because for example,

231
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.180
you can capture and store all this information and you can form explicit links

232
00:12:51.181 --> 00:12:53.730
between them and everything is organized and searchable.

233
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.690
And I think there's something to that there's certainly value in that use case.

234
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.410
But I believe that most of the creative work, the mind does,

235
00:13:01.411 --> 00:13:05.400
especially around generating new ideas is not done in your thinking mind.

236
00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:07.380
It's basically not done consciously.

237
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.830
You have this massively parallel process running in your background,

238
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:14.640
including when you're sleeping, that's generating new ideas, forming,

239
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.150
forming new connections. And you basically can't think your way.

240
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.730
Can't put one foot in front of the other to get to new ideas like that.

241
00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:23.700
You have to just kind of let it go wild and hope it comes up with something.

242
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.140
And the way you feed that process is you ruminate over a lot of interesting

243
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.160
intellectual material.

244
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.780
So the reason I think these apps are useful for Tucson is twofold.

245
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.610
One is people like to use them.

246
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.460
They just like to spend time writing notes and Rome,

247
00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:40.980
and kind of regardless of where those notes end up,

248
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.100
where if you ever read them again, just the process of writing and thinking,

249
00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:46.980
as you're writing generates a lot of fodder for this process in your,

250
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.050
in your sleeping mind. And number two,

251
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.050
increasingly these tools support multimedia,

252
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.700
and I've long said creative thinking never takes just one medium.

253
00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:59.550
It's never just texts or just images and tools like Figma.

254
00:13:59.551 --> 00:14:03.540
It's very easy to make a canvas where you have images and text and vector

255
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:06.480
graphics and so on all in one place. I think that's important because that's,

256
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.730
again, naturally how the mind thinks creatively.

257
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.050
<v 1>Sure. I'm a big believer in the, as you said, feeding the sleeping mind problem,</v>

258
00:14:13.051 --> 00:14:17.520
working on problems in the background, stewing and yeah, this externalizing,

259
00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:22.110
your thoughts in some form is a way that helps you turn it over.

260
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.740
And that can be lots of different forms. It can be sketching.

261
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:28.800
It can be writing voice memoing is another interesting trick.

262
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.520
Even just talking to another person, right? This is where an open-ended chat,

263
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.500
you know, the classic water cooler talk,

264
00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:36.900
or just taking a walk and talking with a colleague,

265
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.440
working through something that, that helps seed that, uh, that stewing,

266
00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:43.380
that background process in the brain. And I agree, whatever it is,

267
00:14:43.381 --> 00:14:47.730
should be enjoyable and comfortable. And so that means for, uh, something like,

268
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:49.320
and one of these analog tools.

269
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:53.900
I think the reason why sketchbooks and mole skins and whatever have continued to

270
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:57.770
have such a place in the heart of creative people like me and many others is

271
00:14:57.771 --> 00:14:58.700
that they're just enjoyable.

272
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:02.030
You grew up a nice pen and the feeling that tactile feeling of your,

273
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.950
your hand moving across the page,

274
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:07.700
I think whiteboards good whiteboard can have a similar feeling as well.

275
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.460
And with digital tools you need, you need the same thing.

276
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:15.290
If it's fun and enjoyable to open a new notion page and assign it an emoji

277
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.131
and dragon,

278
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:20.660
some media and type out your text and then share it with a colleague for

279
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:22.850
discussion, then you're going to want to do it.

280
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.360
And then that in turn is a nice virtuous cycle.

281
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.840
<v 0>Yeah. And this is a podcast about tools for thought,</v>

282
00:15:28.841 --> 00:15:30.640
and I think it's appropriate to, you know, keep it scoped.

283
00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:35.230
But I would say that human creative process is so much bigger than tools.

284
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.300
Things like, uh, the social element, you know,

285
00:15:37.301 --> 00:15:41.050
who you're talking to and who you're motivated by, uh, the physicality element,

286
00:15:41.051 --> 00:15:42.070
the position of your body,

287
00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:45.370
how it's moving or not the location element like we were talking about in the

288
00:15:45.371 --> 00:15:47.260
intro, these are all super important.

289
00:15:47.261 --> 00:15:51.310
And I think it's easy for us as technologists to over-rotate towards what's on

290
00:15:51.311 --> 00:15:54.460
the rectangular screen when there's so much more to the creative process.

291
00:15:54.461 --> 00:15:56.200
And again, that's something we've tried to tap into with muse.

292
00:15:56.201 --> 00:15:59.440
So that for example, you can use it while you're reclining on your comfy couch,

293
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.560
or you can use both your hands at the same time and use all the degrees of

294
00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.420
freedom you have in your arms. Things like that.

295
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.220
<v 1>Absolutely. Related to that.</v>

296
00:16:06.221 --> 00:16:09.550
One thing I wanted to ask you about is whether you'd read this book thinking

297
00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:13.540
fast and slow by Daniel Conaman yep. Classic. Yeah.

298
00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.050
I found myself thinking about that in this tools of thought context.

299
00:16:17.051 --> 00:16:20.730
So just to briefly summarize for, uh, for those that are not familiar,

300
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.360
the author basically categorizes our ways of thinking in daily life.

301
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:30.360
In these two creatively named system one and system two brains where

302
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.540
system one is more the, the fast thinking, the, the quick judgment,

303
00:16:34.541 --> 00:16:39.400
the immediate reaction and the system two brain is slower, more analytical.

304
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.910
I especially like the system one brains main,

305
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.320
the framing that the system one brains main job is this assessing normality.

306
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.490
They call it. That is to say,

307
00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:52.570
we have these built in habits and assumptions about the world is worldview in

308
00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:53.260
this,

309
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.970
just this way that we expect things to be everything from how my furniture is

310
00:16:57.971 --> 00:16:59.680
arranged in my home,

311
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.460
to what the political landscape is like in my nation,

312
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.530
our system one brains are constantly taking stock of whether what they're seeing

313
00:17:08.531 --> 00:17:12.850
fits into that established pattern and essentially kind of raises a flag or

314
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:16.600
raises something into our attention when something breaks that pattern.

315
00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.590
So that system one fast instinctive emotional brain,

316
00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.970
I think is pretty natural to reach for in certainly in social settings,

317
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.020
but especially in information, age style, um,

318
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.380
online gathering places, the social media and so on.

319
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.860
Whereas the system too is obviously what we're most interested in,

320
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:38.770
in our team and with the tool for thought that we're building,

321
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.810
which is the slower, more deliberate, more logical, analytical, slower,

322
00:17:43.811 --> 00:17:45.700
both in a literal time sense,

323
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.490
but also in a sense of more consideration and purposely

324
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:55.170
breaking the habits that are already in your mind and trying to form new

325
00:17:55.171 --> 00:17:56.004
connections.

326
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.840
<v 0>Yeah, I think that's true, but I also think there's value and domesticating,</v>

327
00:17:59.841 --> 00:18:04.670
if you will, the system one mind, it's so powerful, but it's also by default,

328
00:18:04.671 --> 00:18:09.470
very wild and instinctual. But if you give it the right care and feeding with,

329
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.191
uh, the,

330
00:18:10.191 --> 00:18:13.100
the right intellectual material that you're ruminating on to continue the animal

331
00:18:13.101 --> 00:18:15.560
metaphor here, um, it can be very powerful. And again,

332
00:18:15.561 --> 00:18:18.260
I think this is especially true in your sleep basically,

333
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.770
where if you take in the right materials, do the right active reading.

334
00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.390
And if you give that a few days,

335
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:25.850
you'll often form interesting new connections and ideas.

336
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.900
<v 1>For me, a go-to technique is to literally sleep on it. And in fact,</v>

337
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.090
I've even brought this up often enough on teams.

338
00:18:32.091 --> 00:18:33.680
Sometimes that people poke fun at me,

339
00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:36.560
that my solution to any tough problem is to go to sleep.

340
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.270
But I really find that so many breakthrough solutions or new

341
00:18:41.271 --> 00:18:45.710
ways of looking at something have occurred to me after that stepping away and

342
00:18:45.711 --> 00:18:49.160
particularly the restorative power of, of sleep.

343
00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.140
And what happens to your mind that time.

344
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.320
And that obviously just actually requires time. You can't,

345
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:58.040
if you're trying to turn around a decision the same day, you can't,

346
00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.010
you can't sleep on it either literally or figuratively.

347
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:05.750
And so trying to maybe arrange your creative life or set things up in your work

348
00:19:05.751 --> 00:19:10.280
or other places where you want to make good decisions and have good ideas to

349
00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:13.430
allow yourself this time. I know on the muse team,

350
00:19:13.431 --> 00:19:18.380
we often like to do things in pairs or each of us I've seen likes to

351
00:19:18.381 --> 00:19:19.490
do things in parallel.

352
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.760
We may have a few different projects going on at a time that even,

353
00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:24.860
maybe you switch back and forth between a little bit,

354
00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:29.330
sometimes that can be lack of focus, which is a bad sign. But in some cases,

355
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.350
I find this as a really effective way to work on something for a while.

356
00:19:33.351 --> 00:19:37.310
Maybe get a little stuck or not be sure what the best path forward is sort of

357
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:40.820
step away, switch my context for a few days or something.

358
00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:41.810
And when I come back to it,

359
00:19:41.811 --> 00:19:45.740
I'm fresh because in a way this background process has been working on the

360
00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:46.760
problem the whole time.

361
00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.460
<v 0>Yep. And then bringing it back to tools for thought,</v>

362
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.000
I think it's important then that the tools not try to draw too straight of a

363
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.820
line between ideas and steps. Often,

364
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.030
I feel like tools are trying to get the inputs in you form the right

365
00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:02.060
connections. And then somehow the tool will like lead you to the right answer.

366
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.640
I think the process is just inherently much messier than that.

367
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.530
And you need to let go a little bit and say,

368
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.920
the tool is going to help you make this stew and then you'll sleep on it for a

369
00:20:09.921 --> 00:20:11.210
few days. And then somewhere else,

370
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.970
something new will pop out and you might not even be able to see that straight

371
00:20:13.971 --> 00:20:16.340
line, right. And it might not be reified in the tool,

372
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.100
but you have to trust that process is going to happen in your sleeping mind.

373
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.470
<v 1>Another area under tools for thought,</v>

374
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:24.890
I was curious to get your take on is the role of attention and focus.

375
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.240
And I touched on that with the system one brain and how it surfaces things to

376
00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:30.530
the, to the system, to,

377
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.760
in the process of doing deep work and do going deep on a problem.

378
00:20:34.761 --> 00:20:37.880
We know it's important to be able to focus on something deeply,

379
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.830
but how do you see that as interacting with a tool for thought like news or

380
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.733
these other.

381
00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:44.991
<v 0>W well,</v>

382
00:20:44.991 --> 00:20:48.610
now that you mentioned that my half joking answer is perhaps the most powerful

383
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:51.640
tool for thought that I have is industrial strength, noise,

384
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:54.520
canceling headphones, like the type you wear when you're using a chainsaw,

385
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
it's actually very helpful and blotting out the noise that I have here in the

386
00:20:58.001 --> 00:20:58.770
city.

387
00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:00.390
<v 1>I'm controlling noise in your environment.</v>

388
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.370
I think it was one of our very first email updates from use that we linked to a,

389
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.760
what I think of as a very useful tool in the creative person's toolkit,

390
00:21:08.761 --> 00:21:12.570
which is a white noise generator. Uh, in this case it was one for the,

391
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.500
for the iPhone, but I've used a web-based white noise generator that does,

392
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:16.771
you know,

393
00:21:16.771 --> 00:21:20.610
rainfall and fireplace crackling and whatever that I can put into a pair of

394
00:21:20.611 --> 00:21:23.130
headphones, especially noise canceling headphones.

395
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.700
That can be really nice for particularly you're in a noisy environment,

396
00:21:26.701 --> 00:21:29.790
like trying to work on a plane or a train or something like that,

397
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.230
because absolutely it takes effort to keep your attention on something.

398
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.950
And the more that your environment demands your attention, the more you,

399
00:21:37.951 --> 00:21:40.890
the less effort you will have to spend on the thing you're trying to focus on.

400
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.220
That's why I like quiet office, physical space,

401
00:21:44.221 --> 00:21:46.260
that's conducive to doing work.

402
00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:51.180
<v 0>I think if there's even the possibility that you'll be distracted or pulled back</v>

403
00:21:51.181 --> 00:21:53.640
from your creative thought process, it's hard to get into it.

404
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.130
I remember this one, I was a full-time programmer.

405
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.730
Even that I had a meeting on my calendar at like 3:00 PM,

406
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.730
made it hard to do certain programming problems in the beginning of the day.

407
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.100
It's because you knew at some point you were going to be interrupted and you had

408
00:22:05.101 --> 00:22:07.620
to break your train of thought. I think there's the same dynamic happening.

409
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.720
If you know that that little red dot could come up,

410
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.730
or if you could get a notification pop on your screen.

411
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.840
So one idea we've had with music to really be respectful and giving the creator

412
00:22:15.841 --> 00:22:19.500
control over if they're ever going to have anything interrupt their work and

413
00:22:19.501 --> 00:22:20.700
anything else appear on their screen.

414
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.990
<v 1>The reason I brought it up was I, I see this as, I guess, coming back to the,</v>

415
00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.910
this glorious vision for what computers could do for people some decades back

416
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.340
and where we are today, attention,

417
00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:36.360
or really a direct conflict between what you want out of call.

418
00:22:36.361 --> 00:22:37.920
It consumption technology.

419
00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:42.450
So when it comes to your phone and your messaging apps and your social media,

420
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:44.820
precisely what you want is to feel connected.

421
00:22:44.821 --> 00:22:48.060
You literally want to be interrupted. That is the feature, the feature of it.

422
00:22:48.061 --> 00:22:50.250
You want to feel connected to what's going on and you know,

423
00:22:50.251 --> 00:22:51.990
about the breaking news right away.

424
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.540
And when there's some important message from,

425
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.660
from thing that's happened with your team or thing that's happened in your

426
00:22:57.661 --> 00:23:00.150
family, that you're going to find out, be connected to that,

427
00:23:00.151 --> 00:23:03.780
be able to turn around and respond immediately. And that's well and good,

428
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.440
but it is just in direct opposition to what you want.

429
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.220
If you want to sit down and get a really big chunk of productive work done,

430
00:23:11.221 --> 00:23:16.020
or particularly bring your energy and attention to bear on a problem that is

431
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.380
maybe just past what you're currently capable of doing,

432
00:23:19.381 --> 00:23:21.660
whether that's a new thing you're trying to learn,

433
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:26.700
whether it's because you're an academic, that's trying to develop a fresh idea.

434
00:23:26.701 --> 00:23:28.710
That's pushing the boundaries of science,

435
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.590
whether it's you're a product creator or a startup person,

436
00:23:31.591 --> 00:23:35.610
and you're trying to figure out the strategy for your company or something like

437
00:23:35.611 --> 00:23:36.630
that. You've got to,

438
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.170
you've got to really push yourself and you need every spare,

439
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:45.030
or you need every single cycle of your brain computing power you can get.

440
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.160
And anything that draws your attention away or demand your attention interferes

441
00:23:49.161 --> 00:23:53.360
with that makes you slightly less able to go after solving that problem.

442
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.370
<v 0>Yeah, totally.</v>

443
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:59.350
I think a related idea on this theme of Headspace and how you're feeling is

444
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.210
the aesthetics of the tool environment.

445
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.530
I think it's really important that creators have control over the aesthetics of

446
00:24:05.531 --> 00:24:08.080
their environment and can change it to their tastes.

447
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:12.340
I think if we told an artist that you have to go into this studio has to be

448
00:24:12.341 --> 00:24:15.940
exactly the size. You can only paint the walls, this one gray color,

449
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:20.050
you can only use this one paintbrush, you have these four colors you can use.

450
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:23.290
Uh, you can only paint in the style. They'd be like, what are you talking about?

451
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.650
We do that all the time with software. Your environment has to look like this.

452
00:24:26.651 --> 00:24:28.540
And by the way, it often looks, and it can,

453
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.220
it can feel trivial just to like to give you users this basic agency over what

454
00:24:33.221 --> 00:24:35.260
they're doing in their environment. I think it's really important.

455
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.620
One small example from users, we have these setting panels type things.

456
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.680
And in most apps, when you open the settings type panel, you know,

457
00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:43.390
it goes in the upper left, or it goes in the upper, right.

458
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.160
And that's that hopefully you're okay with it.

459
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.170
If it's covering some of your content well, too bad,

460
00:24:47.171 --> 00:24:50.290
but we had this idea that even for something as simple as a settings panel,

461
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:52.450
you should be able to put it where you want to put it so that if you have

462
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:54.640
something on the right-hand side of your screen, that you're working on,

463
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.600
you can put the settings on the left or vice versa and just giving users basic

464
00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:00.880
agency over like over their environment like that I think is really cool.

465
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.590
<v 1>Yeah. I think one of our good switch research pieces touched on the desire for</v>

466
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.720
creative types to nest,

467
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.270
where basically when you walk into the professor's office,

468
00:25:10.271 --> 00:25:13.600
when you walk into the designers studio, you see,

469
00:25:13.601 --> 00:25:16.480
tend to see an arrangement that reflects their personality.

470
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.640
They're certainly the needs of their work,

471
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.720
but also as a kind of home kind of a creative home.

472
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.410
And I think that connects not only to the utility of it. Okay. I,

473
00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.320
I tend to use this one tool physical tool.

474
00:25:29.321 --> 00:25:33.310
So therefore it's sitting in a place that's easy for me to reach my desk,

475
00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:36.760
but also just reflects this feeling of comfort,

476
00:25:36.761 --> 00:25:39.040
safety familiarity.

477
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.960
And I think you're able to do your best work and B be creative and productive

478
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:46.120
and focus when you feel those things.

479
00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.490
And it's much harder to do it in an unfamiliar environment,

480
00:25:48.491 --> 00:25:50.950
a sterile environment, one that, um,

481
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.440
when that maybe isn't adapted to your needs in the same way,

482
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:57.220
going back to Andy's great article about tools, for thoughts.

483
00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.850
He has a section there where he talks a bit about sort of the machine learning

484
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:05.170
AI stuff. Now, I guess a GPT three is the new, new buzzy item.

485
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.830
And this is a question I think I've run into quite frequently in,

486
00:26:08.831 --> 00:26:11.950
when I talk about what I've worked on, what I'm working on here at muse,

487
00:26:11.951 --> 00:26:14.260
what I've done as well in the research lab,

488
00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.700
which is to kind of oversimplify the response that often, you know, if I say,

489
00:26:18.701 --> 00:26:21.340
I'm working on tools for thought and kind of describe what that is,

490
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.530
there's a reaction that's well,

491
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.950
pretty soon AI is going to be here and do all our thinking for us. So like,

492
00:26:26.951 --> 00:26:29.890
what's the point of that. And I don't have a great answer to that. Uh,

493
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.750
I don't believe that in my heart,

494
00:26:31.751 --> 00:26:35.260
but maybe that's because I'm incentivized not to believe it because I enjoy

495
00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:39.280
building tools for people to think and create. So maybe I'm,

496
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.490
I have a little bit of applying dye to it, but have you run into that question?

497
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:45.780
And if so, how do you think about the role of let's say AI,

498
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:49.590
however you want to define that in tools for thinking and creativity.

499
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.260
<v 0>There are a lot of interesting areas where AI is vastly superior,</v>

500
00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:56.330
but people are still really interested and learning.

501
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.840
So my favorite examples here are chess and go. And other games like that,

502
00:26:59.841 --> 00:27:01.550
the computers now are insanely powerful.

503
00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.090
People still love learning those games cause there's the intellectual challenge

504
00:27:05.091 --> 00:27:05.924
and the reward.

505
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.440
And I actually think a really interesting frontier for tools of thought is how

506
00:27:09.441 --> 00:27:14.120
do you leverage this amazing AI power to help people learn these games

507
00:27:14.121 --> 00:27:15.710
faster in a programmatic way?

508
00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:19.790
So I could imagine something in the style of Andy's pneumonic medium,

509
00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:20.960
which is in his case,

510
00:27:20.961 --> 00:27:24.890
it's using space repetition to help you stay at the frontier of your knowledge.

511
00:27:24.891 --> 00:27:27.170
So you're kind of when you're on the brink of forgetting or when it's most

512
00:27:27.171 --> 00:27:29.810
important to learn a concept is when it challenges you with a question.

513
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.750
I could imagine a similar thing, um, applied to a domain,

514
00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:37.010
like a game where instead of having some linear and predetermined set of lessons

515
00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:40.040
or problems, it plays you, it says, okay, these are your weaknesses.

516
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.470
You need to do some exercises. And these three areas,

517
00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:45.080
I'm going to keep giving them to you until you master them.

518
00:27:45.081 --> 00:27:46.820
And then we'll move on to the next area that can all be done.

519
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.640
Programmatically because these computers have a much better understanding of the

520
00:27:49.641 --> 00:27:51.350
game than we ever will. Even experts.

521
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.930
<v 1>Chess actually makes me think of this book.</v>

522
00:27:53.931 --> 00:27:57.410
I read a little while back by Gary Kasparov, I just looked it up.

523
00:27:57.411 --> 00:28:01.610
It's called a deep thinking where machine intelligence ends and human creativity

524
00:28:01.611 --> 00:28:05.060
begins and famously. This guy is both the chess.

525
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.610
One of the world famous sort of, um,

526
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.870
what's the word for a chess Grandmaster or whatever, the,

527
00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:13.340
the highest ranked chess player in the world for, for a period of time.

528
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.650
But he was the one who was first,

529
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:20.120
the first time that the best human at chess in the world at the time was beaten

530
00:28:20.121 --> 00:28:23.690
by a computer and many S really heralded that it was this huge,

531
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:28.100
certainly PR win for the people that were building these AI algorithms. Uh,

532
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.970
but for a lot of people that it really heralded the beginning of called robots

533
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.940
taking our job or the AI is going to be here or what have you. And he gets it's.

534
00:28:36.941 --> 00:28:40.010
It's so interesting because on one hand he just reflects on the experience of

535
00:28:40.011 --> 00:28:43.580
that just being, so I'm not sure what the word is for the, the, the,

536
00:28:43.581 --> 00:28:48.050
he walks through the experience of grappling with this alien intelligence or

537
00:28:48.051 --> 00:28:51.200
this thing that plays the game in a way that is so different from any,

538
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.340
how any human would.

539
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.820
Then he goes on to talk about how the game has changed in the year of sense,

540
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:56.601
which is now,

541
00:28:56.601 --> 00:28:59.990
it's just taken for granted that chess computers are better than human players,

542
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:00.560
period,

543
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.000
but it didn't necessarily lead to a generalized artificial intelligence for now.

544
00:29:05.001 --> 00:29:08.840
You just, computers are, can be extremely good at playing chess.

545
00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.100
And that doesn't really seem to lead to something beyond that. You know,

546
00:29:13.101 --> 00:29:15.380
you can obviously go from there to, okay, now they can play go,

547
00:29:15.381 --> 00:29:16.670
and they can play StarCraft.

548
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:20.240
Maybe that does eventually lead to something general purpose. But the,

549
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:23.600
that the point you mentioned that made me think of the book was he talked about

550
00:29:23.601 --> 00:29:25.130
how the game has changed in the form.

551
00:29:25.131 --> 00:29:29.330
That really what it comes down to is humans and computers collaborate to play

552
00:29:29.331 --> 00:29:32.000
their best game. They analyze, for example,

553
00:29:32.001 --> 00:29:34.550
the games of the players that they're going to go up against.

554
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:38.000
So even if you're not using a computer at the time of playing the game,

555
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.210
your game has changed substantially because you have this computer,

556
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:45.520
I don't know what it is, assistant helping you in the training, the analysis,

557
00:29:45.521 --> 00:29:48.160
the pregame, the post game. Um, and so in fact,

558
00:29:48.161 --> 00:29:50.620
we're seeing that it's not really that chess,

559
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:54.220
AI replaces human chess playing it's more than it's,

560
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.610
it's just morphed the whole morph the whole sport, right?

561
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.300
<v 0>And I think that points to the general future here, it's,</v>

562
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.470
it's not AIS taking over all our jobs and our work is more of a symbiosis and

563
00:30:04.471 --> 00:30:05.250
collaboration.

564
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:09.270
Perhaps the most obvious version of this is the AI is very good at generating a

565
00:30:09.271 --> 00:30:10.890
bunch of plausible possibility,

566
00:30:10.891 --> 00:30:15.060
especially when like GP T3 just spits out a bunch of texts and maybe 90% of them

567
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.360
are no better than plausible. Like if you read them closely,

568
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.220
don't really make sense. But one out of 10, the human can say, Oh,

569
00:30:20.221 --> 00:30:21.450
that's actually quite interesting.

570
00:30:21.451 --> 00:30:24.000
I'm going to that one for my business email or what have you.

571
00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.130
So I think we'll see a whole wave of tools like that,

572
00:30:26.131 --> 00:30:30.840
but otherwise I'll believe that the takeover of AI when, uh, I see it, uh,

573
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.600
productivity statistics, which of course we haven't for some decades.

574
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:38.610
<v 1>Yeah. I think on the creative tools in tandem or in symbiosis with a</v>

575
00:30:38.611 --> 00:30:42.420
human generative design, I think is one area that has gotten some,

576
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.350
some buzz on that.

577
00:30:43.351 --> 00:30:47.730
And that's the basic idea that you can feed a computer algorithm or an AI of

578
00:30:47.731 --> 00:30:50.910
some kind, a set of constraints for a problem. You have, you know,

579
00:30:50.911 --> 00:30:52.920
you're designing a building and you want it to be this,

580
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.310
hold this many people and have these kinds of structural qualities and have this

581
00:30:56.311 --> 00:30:57.840
kinds of aesthetic qualities.

582
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.690
And it essentially generates you a bunch of options.

583
00:31:00.691 --> 00:31:04.050
And then you can choose between them and kind of winnow winnow down.

584
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:08.880
So this is kind of assistive tools often that has to do with more the called the

585
00:31:08.881 --> 00:31:12.360
brute force, the ability to generate lots of options and lots of weird options,

586
00:31:12.361 --> 00:31:15.990
potentially, uh, actually one place that, um, I've used that thing,

587
00:31:15.991 --> 00:31:20.460
not a out AI, but just an algorithm is in naming several different companies,

588
00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:22.470
including Heroku and in-kind switch.

589
00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.370
I basically wrote little programs that took some of our raw input that we

590
00:31:26.371 --> 00:31:29.970
brainstormed and combine them together in every feasible way.

591
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.110
In the case of in-kind switch,

592
00:31:31.111 --> 00:31:33.750
we knew we wanted two words separated by an ampersand.

593
00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.560
We came up with every word for each slot, a and slot B that we wanted.

594
00:31:37.561 --> 00:31:40.770
And I just wrote a program that spit out every single possible combination.

595
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.950
And we could go through them and look for what we liked best as that that's

596
00:31:43.951 --> 00:31:45.990
pretty far from generative design, I suppose, but,

597
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.340
but it fits into this general assistive tools thing. And certainly one thing I,

598
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.850
I hear from folks a lot when they talk about this as, okay,

599
00:31:53.851 --> 00:31:57.180
we we've come to accept autocorrect in our writing. Uh,

600
00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:59.100
what's the auto-correct for thinking.

601
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.310
<v 0>No, I feel like it's getting worse. It's just like, it's going rogue.</v>

602
00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:03.750
It says underlining random words. Now.

603
00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.060
<v 1>I actually did an experiment.</v>

604
00:32:06.061 --> 00:32:10.350
Some I got irritated enough with autocorrect in terms of it's great when it

605
00:32:10.351 --> 00:32:14.310
works, but when it doesn't, it's way more effort to go back and correct,

606
00:32:14.311 --> 00:32:17.010
or yeah, it's way more, more effort to get what you want.

607
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.400
I did an experiment for a little while of just turning off autocorrect on my

608
00:32:20.401 --> 00:32:24.150
phone, actually, you know what I think I was about as fast,

609
00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:26.220
I was like slower overall, uh,

610
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.010
or slower on individual words that auto-correct would have gotten.

611
00:32:29.011 --> 00:32:31.710
But if you took away the correcting for mistakes,

612
00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.850
a thing that I so often had to do it, I think it came out as kind of a net,

613
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.833
a wash.

614
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:41.240
And then also not being fraud there definitely an emotional win to not being

615
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:43.010
frustrated with the thing, uh,

616
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.250
autocorrecting person's name or what her for the 10th time.

617
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.010
<v 0>Another potential angle on AI and tools for thought is via social networks.</v>

618
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.740
As much as I like tools and software,

619
00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:57.430
it's probably the case that the most powerful technologies, if we will,

620
00:32:57.431 --> 00:33:00.490
that we have for thought are the social networks and the institutions that we're

621
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.930
participating in, the thoughts that we have are so influenced by our friends,

622
00:33:04.931 --> 00:33:08.230
our colleagues who are talking to what we're seeing. And of course,

623
00:33:08.231 --> 00:33:11.710
we're seeing a lot of that happening via social networks these days.

624
00:33:11.711 --> 00:33:13.930
And there's a lot of ways you can say that's bad or troublesome,

625
00:33:13.931 --> 00:33:15.100
and there's certainly some work to do,

626
00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.320
but just something like YouTube or Twitter,

627
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:21.280
being able to help you find people in your area of interest to talk to and learn

628
00:33:21.281 --> 00:33:23.110
from is very powerful.

629
00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:26.410
And I think there's actually a lot more we could do in that space that is using

630
00:33:26.411 --> 00:33:29.980
AI to build robust social networks that in turn helps you have better thoughts.

631
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:33.940
<v 1>Yeah. That also connects back to the creative fodder idea. As we've said,</v>

632
00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.790
many times for ideas, don't come from nowhere, they're,

633
00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:40.180
they're brick collage of other ideas. Where does that come from? Well,

634
00:33:40.181 --> 00:33:42.850
exposing yourself to as many different ideas as you can,

635
00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.640
through the many different sources as you can. Something like Twitter,

636
00:33:45.641 --> 00:33:50.200
for example, is just a really amazing place to do that. YouTube as well can be.

637
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:50.651
Now,

638
00:33:50.651 --> 00:33:55.210
I think it's hard or even impossible to have your own ideas or have original

639
00:33:55.211 --> 00:33:58.360
ideas. If you're constantly plugged in, same thing is true at a,

640
00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.970
like a work or a team level, your company, Slack,

641
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.680
your whatever other formats you have for connecting with your colleagues.

642
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:10.720
It's really powerful to be connected to that group mind and be

643
00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.890
influenced to bombarded by and influenced by all the ideas and opinions.

644
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.830
But in the end, if you want to have an original thought,

645
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.740
I think you need to disconnect from that a little bit,

646
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.490
but to completely disconnect, you'll just won't have that fodder.

647
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.140
But if you're plugged in all the time,

648
00:34:26.141 --> 00:34:29.230
you'll just never have an original thought because you're just being pushed to

649
00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:31.090
and fro by everyone else's ideas.

650
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.560
And so there's some pendulum swing of connection to

651
00:34:35.561 --> 00:34:38.830
isolation, where you can connect for awhile,

652
00:34:38.831 --> 00:34:41.320
get all that fodder disconnect a little bit,

653
00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:44.800
go a little deeper on your own ideas, come back and reconnect.

654
00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.960
So thinking about the future,

655
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:50.980
we've already seen some exciting movement in tools for thought making it into

656
00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:54.850
production or commercial environments with things like notion, Rome, Figma,

657
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:59.830
as well as great research work like Andy's work on pneumonic devices or

658
00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:04.600
something like On-key the space repetition system that's kind of related to

659
00:35:04.601 --> 00:35:05.170
that.

660
00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.460
What do you think the future holds particularly given the public goods problem?

661
00:35:09.461 --> 00:35:12.130
You mentioned earlier of how this stuff gets funded.

662
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.340
Are we going to enter a Renaissance where we can maybe finally reach the

663
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.610
beautiful vision that these folks from the sixties and seventies,

664
00:35:18.611 --> 00:35:22.300
eighties outlined, do you think there's a new direction where things will go,

665
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:26.650
uh, is it going to continue to be hard to get tools of thought built in today's

666
00:35:26.651 --> 00:35:27.370
world?

667
00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.830
<v 0>The economics problem is going to remain hard,</v>

668
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:31.750
but not insurmountable at which I mean,

669
00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:34.420
these things are inherently somewhat of a public good.

670
00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.970
It's hard to fund them slash capture the value when you make great.

671
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.780
And I think that's going to be the case for the foreseeable future,

672
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.330
given the social technology that we have. But that said,

673
00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:45.510
I feel like it's still very doable to make a lot of progress in these areas.

674
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:48.360
And it just takes a bit of, of will and vision,

675
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.800
and perhaps the willingness to forego maximum economic return for yourself

676
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:53.280
personally.

677
00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.760
But I feel like even small teams with today's technology can make a lot of

678
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:58.110
progress. And I think we're seeing that.

679
00:35:58.111 --> 00:36:00.180
And I think in the substance of the tools, I think first of all,

680
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:02.910
we're going to continue to see certain trends, keep playing out.

681
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.990
So one is this trend of, uh, mixed media and multimedia in the same tool.

682
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.950
And that's very important. I think with tools like notion and Figma and Rome,

683
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:12.780
people are becoming more and more accustomed to that,

684
00:36:12.781 --> 00:36:15.390
and that's going to be baked in and we're going to be less tolerant of tools

685
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:17.460
that are strictly for one medium.

686
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.210
I think another trend that we're continuing to see is the improved aesthetics

687
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:25.200
slash the consumerization of industrial strength thinking tools, which again,

688
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:26.093
I think is great.

689
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:31.130
<v 1>It needs to be fun, fast, a little playful. You could argue that mole skin,</v>

690
00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.890
which is, uh, you know, just a sketchbook company,

691
00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:37.880
but I definitely count them as a tool for thought they're more expensive than,

692
00:36:37.881 --> 00:36:42.020
but no better in a practical sense than a GP paper notebook,

693
00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.730
but people like how they feel.

694
00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:48.560
I like how they look and that aesthetic element makes a difference for, I think,

695
00:36:48.561 --> 00:36:51.080
your, your ability to do good creative work.

696
00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:51.980
<v 0>Yep.</v>

697
00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.720
And one of the existing trend that I see continuing and accelerating is leaning

698
00:36:56.721 --> 00:36:59.210
on video slash video games.

699
00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:03.740
These are mediums that were hard to use or hard to produce content for even five

700
00:37:03.741 --> 00:37:04.574
or 10 years ago.

701
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.160
And now that technology is such that basically anyone can make really high

702
00:37:07.161 --> 00:37:08.420
quality content in these areas.

703
00:37:08.421 --> 00:37:11.390
And so we're seeing more of more and more of that YouTube being the predominant

704
00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:11.721
example.

705
00:37:11.721 --> 00:37:14.660
But I think video and like slash the video game model will be interested,

706
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:17.210
integrated more into tools for thought and then looking forward. Okay.

707
00:37:17.211 --> 00:37:20.390
I think there's a fairly obvious bet about AI that we talked about.

708
00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:22.820
I think that one's been played out a fair amount on Twitter and so on.

709
00:37:22.821 --> 00:37:24.170
So I won't go into that too much here,

710
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:27.350
but if I had to pick one less obvious trends to bet on it would be,

711
00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.760
but if I had to pick one new trend to bet on it would be leveraging software to

712
00:37:31.761 --> 00:37:36.410
enhance these traditionally non Tuli aspects of the creative

713
00:37:36.411 --> 00:37:40.550
process. So the social side, the physicality side,

714
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:41.503
things like that.

715
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.780
I think those are kind of two pretty different worlds historically. Um,

716
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.700
but I see more tools, uh,

717
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.330
bridging that gap and leveraging the importance of those spaces for your

718
00:37:50.331 --> 00:37:51.164
creative process.

719
00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:56.330
<v 1>Yeah. Very interesting. What are some examples of products or companies or, um,</v>

720
00:37:56.360 --> 00:38:00.470
tools that you've seen that tap into this community and people side of things?

721
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:05.240
<v 0>It was often the case that gaming industry was the leader here.</v>

722
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:09.740
So there are now these incredibly sophisticated communities around

723
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.100
individual video games where people follow creators,

724
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:14.850
who they're really interested in, and it started,

725
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.780
you just kind of watched someone playing the video game. Then it'd become these,

726
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:20.330
these social environments where there's a kind of community around it.

727
00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:22.460
And then it becomes a way to learn how to play the game.

728
00:38:22.461 --> 00:38:25.250
Like there's a bunch of tutorials and lessons and you learn from other people in

729
00:38:25.251 --> 00:38:27.140
the community and you watch each other play and stuff like that.

730
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.620
And that's all mediated by technology because it's otherwise very hard for these

731
00:38:30.621 --> 00:38:32.330
people to find their community.

732
00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:35.000
Cause there might be a thousand people in the world who are really into this

733
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.140
niche video game and who are playing at a high level with the right tools and

734
00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:41.590
platforms between like Twitch, YouTube, but the game itself, for example,

735
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:44.050
in discord, you can, you can form a community.

736
00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.640
<v 1>And I'll note that that includes not just playing games,</v>

737
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.070
but also like speed running or something like that,

738
00:38:50.071 --> 00:38:53.670
but also includes creating the games, many indie game developers,

739
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.290
stream themselves, programming the game, designing game on Twitch people,

740
00:38:58.291 --> 00:39:01.110
jump in and watch that and learn from them. And there's also yeah,

741
00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:05.820
huge YouTube communities and channels and things around just generally

742
00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:08.820
learning to program and learning all kinds of technical skills.

743
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.600
Certainly I've learned things about video editing and things like that through,

744
00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.910
through YouTube. So this kind of watch a creator or a producer use some

745
00:39:17.911 --> 00:39:21.810
sophisticated piece of software to do some, do their creative process,

746
00:39:21.811 --> 00:39:23.640
maybe thinking out loud as they do.

747
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:28.440
That's a really powerful way to share tacit knowledge about how people do what

748
00:39:28.441 --> 00:39:29.274
they do. Yeah.

749
00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:30.060
<v 0>And then I think it's true.</v>

750
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.660
Like you're saying it's trickling down from games into more like professional

751
00:39:33.661 --> 00:39:37.800
environments or trade craft environments, things like you said, photo editing,

752
00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:41.850
video editing or things like woodworking are now sophisticated communities

753
00:39:41.851 --> 00:39:43.710
around that and online tools where you can learn.

754
00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.380
But then I think bringing it back to tools for thought,

755
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:48.150
we're starting to see these,

756
00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:52.860
these communities and tools form around more like intellectual topics and ideas.

757
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.610
So there's, there's a bit of a progress studies community developing.

758
00:39:56.611 --> 00:39:57.061
For example,

759
00:39:57.061 --> 00:40:01.740
now we have podcasts and classes and Twitter cohorts

760
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.700
and some slacks and some discords and those feel pretty early,

761
00:40:05.701 --> 00:40:09.660
but it feels like we're bringing some of those patterns and sensibilities from

762
00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:11.850
the gaming world and into these more intellectual.

763
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.160
<v 1>Domains. Right. Well, that comes back to that.</v>

764
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.960
I think when we say tools for thoughts,

765
00:40:15.961 --> 00:40:19.830
sometimes you talk about maybe for example, methodologies,

766
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:24.180
how to work things like getting things done or inbox zero or building a second

767
00:40:24.181 --> 00:40:27.420
brain or something like that. Um, so you've got communities,

768
00:40:27.421 --> 00:40:32.400
you've got software that you run, you've got analog tools, you've got, uh,

769
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:36.330
techniques and methodologies. So really this is, I guess, a lot,

770
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:40.230
a lot broader than just as you said earlier, what goes in the rectangle.

771
00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:45.060
<v 0>And also I think technology is going to infuse all these other areas and we're</v>

772
00:40:45.061 --> 00:40:48.120
going to have a sort of technologies for thought, if you will, um,

773
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:53.070
both software per se, but also communities, networks, methodologies,

774
00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.830
habits, institutions, Twitter threads,

775
00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.200
and so on all working together to help people.

776
00:40:59.220 --> 00:40:59.341
<v 1>Well,</v>

777
00:40:59.341 --> 00:41:03.570
that makes me pretty excited for the future of being a thinker and a creative

778
00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.433
person.

779
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.810
<v 0>Well, with that, I think we can wrap it.</v>

780
00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:10.620
