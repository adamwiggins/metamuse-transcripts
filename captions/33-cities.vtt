00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>Something I really admire about Tokyo is that they are able to,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.820
while it's a very desirable place to live,

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.120
the housing costs in Tokyo actually not that high.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.550
And people are pretty liberal about tearing things down and building new things.

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:19.320
And it seems almost like a cultural love of newness and people are always

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:23.250
excited to like rebuild and create a new thing in a place where an old thing

7
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.084
stood.

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.890
<v 1>Hello and welcome to Metamuse. Muse is a tool for thought on iPad.</v>

9
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.440
But this podcast isn't about Muse the product.

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.690
It's about Muse the company and the small team behind it.

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.470
My name is Adam Wiggins. I'm here with my colleague, Mark McGranaghan.

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.470
<v 2>Hey Adam.</v>

13
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.410
<v 1>And our guest, Devon Zuegel.</v>

14
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.410
<v 0>Hey.</v>

15
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.850
<v 1>And Devon, not too long ago, I would've said of GitHub,</v>

16
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.090
but I believe as a few months ago, you are now a free agent.

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.193
How's life treating you?

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.633
<v 0>It's been great.</v>

19
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.710
I left GitHub about two months ago and I also moved to Miami around the

20
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:02.330
same time from San Francisco.

21
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.120
And so I've been spending my time exploring the city,

22
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.340
writing a number of blog posts about it,

23
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.110
talking to people in the government and like housing developers and that sort of

24
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:16.700
thing, just because that's what I do in my free time is learn about cities.

25
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.250
So it's been really fun to explore my new home.

26
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.600
<v 1>Yeah, typically when people think of Miami,</v>

27
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.920
the first thing they think of is speaking with members from government agencies

28
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:30.250
to better understand how the infrastructure of the city works.

29
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.250
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

30
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.930
<v 1>Makes perfect sense to me.</v>

31
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.060
And can you tell us what your background is, how you came to GitHub?

32
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.620
What came before that, and what might come after?

33
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.300
<v 0>For sure. My background is computer science,</v>

34
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.600
which is probably not a big surprise. I studied that in school.

35
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.800
And then I worked as a software engineer at a number of San Francisco startups.

36
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.330
And then most recently I was a product manager at GitHub for the last two and a

37
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:55.230
half plus years.

38
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.420
I was leading the communities department where we built tools for open source

39
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:01.254
communities.

40
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.670
And so it ties in a lot with my interests and love of cities and economics,

41
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.800
because they're both about sort of what can you do to create an ecosystem and a

42
00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:15.090
platform where people thrive, but without defining it all in advance,

43
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.990
how do you create those building blocks? So people can live their lives,

44
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:19.950
find opportunities,

45
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:24.180
build really interesting things that you never would have dreamed of and help

46
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.020
give them that platform so that they can put those plans together themselves.

47
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.314
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:33.220
It's pretty easy to see the parallels between communities of different types,

49
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:36.070
which includes open source and then cities as well,

50
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.270
which is you can't really do a top-down thing.

51
00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:44.110
I'm sure we'll get into that a bit here. But unlike, for example, me,

52
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.940
my experience in designing products or building software products is often that

53
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.960
you sit down,

54
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.930
you figure out what you want to make and you make that thing and it may or may

55
00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:55.860
not work out the way you want in practice. And then you need to iterate on it,

56
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:56.860
need to get feedback,

57
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.970
but it's a very highly controlled experience.

58
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.660
Whereas something like community can only be grown.

59
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.520
It's incredibly organic.

60
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.870
And I think at best you can kind of guide and obviously

61
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.190
guidance matters a lot because that's why we get some communities that thrive

62
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:16.330
and others that don't,

63
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.410
but it's just nowhere near as prescriptive as what at least I'm used to in

64
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.244
product design.

65
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.640
<v 0>Yeah. And I moved over to product management from software because I really</v>

66
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:29.430
enjoy what I called social technology.

67
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.670
I think that that's really a sweet spot for me where it's thinking about the

68
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:37.560
system in terms of how can you shape and encourage behavior that's healthy,

69
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.910
but also without mandating it like sort of more of a carrot than a stick,

70
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:45.000
perhaps I'm not sure if even that's like the right metaphor.

71
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.980
But I think that cities are a really interesting lens to look at certain types

72
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:53.910
of software because things like social networks,

73
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.030
which I would consider GitHub a social network on some level,

74
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.240
and certainly Twitters Facebooks, Instagrams of the world,

75
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.100
they really are communities of people where you as the designer or the software

76
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:10.050
engineer or whoever's building it don't really control what ends up actually on

77
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:11.130
the screen completely.

78
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.970
So you have to think about what are the affordances that you provide?

79
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.360
What does the design language say about what you're supposed to do here?

80
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.860
Kind of like how restaurants will have a sense of the space.

81
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.800
So if you walk into a really quiet,

82
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.470
classy restaurant with like piano playing in the background,

83
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.510
everything about the space is telling you,

84
00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:34.770
like don't start yelling and like dancing and screaming and whatever.

85
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.440
Like this is a place where you're going to have like a nice steak.

86
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.690
You're going to sit down, you're going to listen to classical music.

87
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.860
But then if you walk into, you know, a Miami club, it's a very different vibe.

88
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:46.650
And it says like you're here to kind of go wild and have fun.

89
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.410
So I think that cities do the same of like,

90
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.750
how does this city encourage you to live your life?

91
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.510
And different cities do that very differently.

92
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.670
And I would love for more software teams who are building places for people to

93
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.250
congregate online, to think about it in those terms,

94
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:06.510
because I think it's been a little bit lacking in the past and I think it can

95
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:10.950
lead to problems for both the creators and the people who are trying to

96
00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:11.940
experience the space.

97
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.040
<v 1>I think that pretty naturally points to our topic today,</v>

98
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.230
which is Order Without Design,

99
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.730
which in fact is a book about urban economics and urban planning.

100
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.320
And you didn't write the book,

101
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.860
but you do have a podcast by the very same name in which you interview the

102
00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:31.790
author of the book. Certainly this is not necessarily about the book itself,

103
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.560
although I think there's lots to discuss there,

104
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:36.710
but also about this larger question of exactly what you said,

105
00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:39.740
how do cities become the way that they are?

106
00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:43.310
Each city has its own different character and some of that evolved organically,

107
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.960
but some of it was active choices made by people governing and living in those

108
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.350
cities. And this is a topic that Mark and I talked about more on the,

109
00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:54.200
let's call it the user perspective, in a previous episode,

110
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:57.980
I'll link in the show notes where we talked about our respective decisions to

111
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.150
depart San Francisco and why he landed in Seattle. And I landed in Berlin.

112
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.110
And when you're in the position of working on a all remote team or a distributed

113
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:08.570
team, and you can basically choose to live anywhere,

114
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.110
or you have the ability to think in terms of not just I'm going to the city

115
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:14.690
because my employer or my school is there, but you're thinking,

116
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:16.610
what are the qualities of the city that I like?

117
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.530
What would make it a good place to live?

118
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.960
That would be creatively inspiring for me,

119
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:24.560
at least that was the experience that got me interested in urban design as a

120
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:25.041
topic,

121
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:29.810
which is seeing the unique character of Berlin and what it was

122
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.040
that spoke to me, spoke to my soul about that and then thinking, okay, well,

123
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.420
how did it get to be that way?

124
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.910
What were the series of decisions and who are the people?

125
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:41.810
And I know how digital products come to be, but how does the city come to be?

126
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.360
So maybe you can illuminate that for us a little bit.

127
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:45.670
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

128
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.870
So this was one of my favorite books and I read it several years ago when it

129
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:53.680
first came out and instantly just had to become friends with the author.

130
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.150
His name is Alain Bertaud, and he and his wife, Marie Agnes,

131
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.040
they're in, I believe their eighties now.

132
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:03.400
And they've spent their life living in a bunch of different cities around the

133
00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:08.110
world, creating their master plans. They worked for the World Bank,

134
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.260
for sanitation systems, transportation systems.

135
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.490
They've been in places really far flung, such like all over the world.

136
00:07:15.491 --> 00:07:19.210
Really they've lived in Bangkok. They lived in Sana'a Yemen.

137
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.920
They've lived in New York city.

138
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.540
I'm missing another dozen or so places that they've lived. Some of these cities,

139
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:27.010
I hadn't even heard of it to be honest.

140
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.070
And so they've seen cities from a lot of different dimensions.

141
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.940
They've experienced lots of different types of people who have different goals

142
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:38.410
for their cities, and they've done their best to shape their work,

143
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.940
to fit those goals of the residents of those different places they've been in

144
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.110
Port-au-Prince Haiti,

145
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.740
where they have a lot of really interesting stories and what you're talking

146
00:07:47.741 --> 00:07:51.610
about here about remote work and how, the way we think about cities differently.

147
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.070
Now that more and more people are working remotely.

148
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.030
Really an interesting lens to think about this book,

149
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.890
because one of Alain Bertauds main points is that historically

150
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:06.280
cities have been labor markets. That's what brings them together.

151
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.760
It's what sort of is the sinew that holds it all together.

152
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.140
And what he means by city or labor markets is that people come to cities to find

153
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:15.850
opportunities, to make their life better.

154
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.490
And certainly they come for a lot of other reasons too,

155
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:23.620
but finding work and finding a way to pay for their life and to better

156
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:25.210
their life is one of the biggest ones.

157
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.680
<v 1>Yeah. At least the way I understood that argument of his was being a labor</v>

158
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:32.740
market is the root of everything else. If you don't have that,

159
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.140
the rest of it won't come. The population density,

160
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.500
that leads into culture and art museums and

161
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.000
interesting cultural scenes emerging. But all of those are secondary effects.

162
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.130
You have to start with the labor market.

163
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.980
<v 0>Right. And I think he would point to places that are,</v>

164
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:49.990
let's say retirement towns.

165
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:52.420
And that sort of thing as somewhat exceptions to the rule,

166
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:54.610
but those will never become massive cities.

167
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.670
Those will never become engines for economic growth for helping people's lives,

168
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:02.910
get a lot better, pulling people out of poverty. They serve a role,

169
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:04.440
but they're not really what he's talking about,

170
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.690
but I think it's really interesting because we're now going into a new era where

171
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.650
more and more work can be done remotely. The labor market is in the cloud.

172
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.300
So if cities no longer have to be the labor market,

173
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.020
what does that look like? How do we now think about the places that we live?

174
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.120
How does that change the decisions that we make?

175
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.020
And sort of that change hasn't completely happened to the vast majority of

176
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:32.550
people still work in person, but there's been a real inflection point.

177
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.130
I'd say in the last 10 years, and certainly with COVID,

178
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.860
that has made people really start to think about this new paradigm.

179
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.030
<v 2>Yeah. And there's sort of two dimensions of effects here.</v>

180
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.990
There's the people are free to potentially move to different cities.

181
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.190
So one can move from San Francisco to Seattle or Berlin or Miami,

182
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.750
or you can move to not a city and participate in a sort of distributed labor

183
00:09:53.751 --> 00:09:56.690
market. And so there's competition along both those axes potentially.

184
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.400
<v 0>Totally for a really long time, choosing to live in a rural place,</v>

185
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.530
dramatically reduced your opportunities.

186
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.530
And some might argue that that's still true.

187
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.100
I personally think that face-to-face has a lot of really important things that

188
00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:14.330
you just can't get via zoom, but at the same time,

189
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.790
there's a whole new frontier opening up here.

190
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.230
And people from all different countries can now participate in labor markets

191
00:10:21.231 --> 00:10:25.100
that used to be centered in the United States, primarily in the case of tech,

192
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.383
for example,

193
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.230
my boyfriend is from Argentina and he moved to the United States several years

194
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:30.531
ago,

195
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:35.510
but many of his friends and family were not able to get visas or weren't

196
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.850
interested in moving. They wanted to stay with their families.

197
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.890
And so they're now able to participate in things that are happening in the

198
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:46.430
United States and, and vice versa in a way that they just couldn't 10 years ago.

199
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.420
So, in a really weird way, there's people who are sitting in Buenos Aires,

200
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.920
but behind a microphone who I feel are a closer part of my

201
00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:57.710
community than some people who are my neighbors.

202
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.400
And that's just a very different world and will really change the way that

203
00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:03.020
cities develop, I think.

204
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.173
<v 2>Yeah, for sure.</v>

205
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.330
And perhaps the most exciting piece for me is you mentioned this idea of social

206
00:11:08.331 --> 00:11:08.901
technologies.

207
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:13.130
I think we're going to see some of the benefits and consequences of cities move

208
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:18.050
out to the cloud. If you will. Things like aggregation effects, quote unquote,

209
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:20.360
population density, self sorting,

210
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.260
these are all things that you really needed to have a city and a physical space

211
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.200
until very recently to get. But now people can, you know, whatever,

212
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:28.310
join the right Discord, something,

213
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.110
that'll be very interesting to see that all play out.

214
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:35.480
<v 0>Yeah. I'm tentatively excited about it. I have some concerns. For example,</v>

215
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:38.960
I was talking to a friend who's a venture capitalist a few days ago.

216
00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.870
And he was telling me about how in 2020,

217
00:11:41.871 --> 00:11:46.070
during COVID roughly the same number of dollars went to venture capital

218
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.620
investments in that year as the previous year.

219
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.050
But it went to half as many companies.

220
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:56.170
And his interpretation of was that the business that VCs are in is to

221
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.680
find people that they trust and that they think will take that money and do

222
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:00.700
something amazing with it.

223
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.230
And his theory here was that because they couldn't meet people face to face,

224
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:07.630
they couldn't build that trust with new people in the network.

225
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.340
And so all of the money was going to people who are already in-network and

226
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.360
already trusted.

227
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.380
And he was a little sad about this because he was thinking like,

228
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.440
there's all these people who would probably be amazing entrepreneurs,

229
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:24.430
but because they didn't have that access that they would have had an in-person

230
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.990
world, they didn't have that.

231
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:29.260
So I'm not sure if that's completely the right interpretation, to be honest.

232
00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:30.910
I think there's a lot of ways to look at that data,

233
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.490
but it did give me pause and think like, oh,

234
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.700
that's like not great if that is the right interpretation.

235
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.840
<v 2>Yeah. And I think it's still very early, you know,</v>

236
00:12:39.841 --> 00:12:40.740
the world doesn't owe it to us.

237
00:12:40.741 --> 00:12:43.830
There's no particular reason this couldn't become very messy and weird for the

238
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:46.590
next 10 or 50 years as it all shakes out.

239
00:12:46.591 --> 00:12:50.160
And we talk often on this podcast about how it takes some time to metabolize

240
00:12:50.161 --> 00:12:51.720
these big society level changes.

241
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.020
I'd say that our technology and our social technology is still very early.

242
00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:58.500
Like the communication bandwidth over zoom is nice as it is versus what we had

243
00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:01.800
five years ago. It's very poor compared to being in person. And likewise,

244
00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:04.590
our social technologies are mostly transliterations of stuff from our previous

245
00:13:04.591 --> 00:13:05.424
physical world.

246
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.340
So I think we solve a lot in front of us to see how it all shakes out.

247
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.400
<v 0>But I'm optimistic. I'm definitely optimistic,</v>

248
00:13:11.401 --> 00:13:13.140
but it's not a done deal for sure.

249
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.140
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

250
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.704
<v 1>So</v>

251
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:17.880
how would you answer the question that I sort of posed earlier?

252
00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.040
The question I pose myself, I suppose,

253
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.790
on discovering a city that I liked really well and wanted to settle in,

254
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.760
just cause I liked it rather than because an employer was there,

255
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.990
which is how do cities become the way that they are. And in particular,

256
00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:33.960
who are the people that make that happen?

257
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.500
<v 0>There's a lot of components that go into that.</v>

258
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.750
I think of cities as an ecosystem.

259
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.610
And so a lot of different pieces have to be in place for them to be the way they

260
00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:45.120
are.

261
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.840
But like geography makes actually a really big difference in the way that people

262
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.230
interact. And that's not human made usually,

263
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.970
but it has a huge difference. Like for example, I live in Miami Beach,

264
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.590
which is separated from mainland Miami. It's on an island.

265
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.460
And so I'm much more likely to spend time with people who are like on the island

266
00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:09.360
with me than I am to like drive into mainland just because there's a body of

267
00:14:09.361 --> 00:14:10.200
water between us.

268
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.880
And so that really shapes the way life and culture work in Miami and similar

269
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.760
geographical features make a big difference in other cities.

270
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.354
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:24.090
One I noted in my own city exploration is San Francisco and Amsterdam two

272
00:14:24.091 --> 00:14:27.810
places I had spent time are both on these kind of fairly smallish peninsulas.

273
00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:31.380
And so they're necessarily constrained on three,

274
00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.770
I guess an island is four sides, but here you're constrained on three sides.

275
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.270
And so there's sort of a limit to how much they can grow or things get denser or

276
00:14:39.271 --> 00:14:42.210
they get more expensive. And by comparison to other places,

277
00:14:42.211 --> 00:14:46.110
Berlin is one example, but probably most places don't have as much constraint.

278
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.600
And as the city grows, they can spread outward.

279
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.090
And in that way kind of create more relief or just more space for more people to

280
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:53.211
be there.

281
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:57.250
<v 0>Totally. And other factors can have a similar effect.</v>

282
00:14:57.251 --> 00:15:02.080
So London and Paris are interesting to contrast to each other where both of them

283
00:15:02.081 --> 00:15:05.920
are inland. They're not on an peninsulas or islands. Well,

284
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.840
I guess Britain is a very large island,

285
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.470
but Paris is much denser than London.

286
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.660
And a big part of that is because Paris was basically conquered and

287
00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.550
like overrun again and again.

288
00:15:18.551 --> 00:15:22.780
So they built these like city walls to protect it and they wanted to keep as

289
00:15:22.781 --> 00:15:27.370
much of the buildings inside of those walls as possible. And the denser it is,

290
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.300
the easier it is to defend. Whereas London being in Great Britain,

291
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:34.990
which is separated by the channel, they just didn't have those problems.

292
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.980
They were much harder--much easier to defend, much harder to attack.

293
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:44.050
And so London is much more sprawling than is Paris. And that's sort of a,

294
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.960
I don't know if it was a conscious decision by any person,

295
00:15:46.961 --> 00:15:50.350
but just the factors that they had to deal with resulted in a very different

296
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.310
city form. So I guess those are two answers, geography,

297
00:15:54.311 --> 00:15:58.660
and like sort of exogenous factors that just kind of force you into this shape

298
00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:59.523
for survival.

299
00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.150
I think another piece is decisions that are made early on in the city's history.

300
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:09.130
There's an immense path dependence in cities because it's painful to tear

301
00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:11.650
things down, unlike in software where it's like,

302
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.560
not that costly and this kind of infinite space,

303
00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:16.510
you can always write more software for the most part.

304
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.160
<v 1>Developers get excited when they see a huge number of red dashes in their pull</v>

305
00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:21.880
request. Right?

306
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.960
<v 0>Yeah. They love it because it simplifies things. Whereas in cities, you know,</v>

307
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:26.020
someone like--

308
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.490
<v 1>Creative destruction.</v>

309
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:31.510
<v 0>Yeah. They put up a bunch of bricks and like they paid money for them to go up.</v>

310
00:16:31.511 --> 00:16:35.770
And it's a more zero sum game in cities than it is in software.

311
00:16:35.771 --> 00:16:38.890
Because anytime you build something that means someone else can't build

312
00:16:38.891 --> 00:16:40.930
something there until they tear your thing down.

313
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.980
And so it leads to very different dynamics and you get much more constrained,

314
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.400
like a concrete example of that is here in Miami Beach.

315
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.710
There's a lot of beautiful art deco buildings.

316
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.750
Miami beach is really famous for this.

317
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.820
And so there are rules protecting the art deco because it's a national

318
00:16:57.821 --> 00:16:59.350
treasure and you know, I really love them.

319
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:03.400
But what that means is that you can't build something else there and this is a

320
00:17:03.401 --> 00:17:07.060
beautiful place to live. It would be awesome if more people could live here,

321
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.250
but because the art deco is there, we can't do that.

322
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.580
And it forces you to make different types of trade-offs.

323
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:17.650
Do you value this architectural heritage or do you value having many more people

324
00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:20.710
be able to live in a place and every community is going to make different

325
00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:21.544
choices there.

326
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:22.481
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

327
00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:25.510
And I think an important thread through everything you just described is that

328
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.950
ultimately it's individuals making personal choices in this sort of

329
00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.960
organic, chaotic mass that ultimately bubbles up to the emergent order,

330
00:17:34.961 --> 00:17:37.870
if you will, that you see in cities. And I think it's so easy,

331
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.060
especially as software people have to think about, you know,

332
00:17:40.061 --> 00:17:42.160
that the city does this, or we should do that.

333
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.830
And really it's just a bunch of individual human beings ultimately have to make

334
00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:46.390
the decisions and take the actions.

335
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.940
<v 1>And this, the, I don't know,</v>

336
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.190
subtitle or the part that goes after the colon in the Order Without Design book

337
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:55.410
title is How Markets Shape Cities. And of course,

338
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:58.740
markets are very much decentralized, you know,

339
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:01.440
individual actors pursuing their own means,

340
00:18:01.441 --> 00:18:05.550
but then that forms into a larger something that is greater than the sum of its

341
00:18:05.551 --> 00:18:07.860
parts. Also, if I'm not mistaken.

342
00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:11.730
One of the interesting things about the authors experience is he had actually

343
00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:14.640
worked for centrally planned economies including,

344
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.680
I believe some Soviet work in the 1980s before the USSR

345
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.560
ended and then also for the Chinese government.

346
00:18:22.561 --> 00:18:27.420
And so he had the chance to even compare a situation where there is no

347
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.930
kind of classic market forces like rent figure out, you know,

348
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:31.890
efficient land use.

349
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.850
Instead there is urban planners that do just sit there and say,

350
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:38.160
we should put houses over here and restaurants over here.

351
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.430
<v 0>Yeah. And he also worked in China during the period where they were liberalizing</v>

352
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.870
economically and moving from a completely communist plan,

353
00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:52.100
centrally planned government to trying to make things a little bit more free

354
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.510
market from the economic side.

355
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.230
And one of the things that he pointed out was that like,

356
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.880
there are a lot of very strict rules that the Chinese government adhered to.

357
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.080
So for example,

358
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.820
there was a rule proposed by the government that said every single room and

359
00:19:07.821 --> 00:19:10.700
every building has to have at least one hour of sunlight throughout the whole

360
00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:13.730
year. Now that sounds like a good idea.

361
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.910
Like I want to have sunlight in my house. Sunlight's a nice thing.

362
00:19:16.911 --> 00:19:18.680
And even one hour almost seems kind of low,

363
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.330
but the issue is that China is a really large country and goes very,

364
00:19:23.331 --> 00:19:27.200
very far north where there's actually just not that much sunlight at all during

365
00:19:27.201 --> 00:19:27.830
much of the year.

366
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:32.480
And so there's some cities in Northern China that were forced to build

367
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.580
the buildings extremely far apart so that the angle of the sun would

368
00:19:37.581 --> 00:19:41.420
like properly hit the inside of the buildings for like the minimum number of

369
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.343
hours a day.

370
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.250
And what this meant was that cities in the north are much less densely populated

371
00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:49.430
and much more spread out than the ones in the south.

372
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.660
And it correlates almost perfectly with this angle to the sun.

373
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.800
And what it means is like this has a lot of other implications for the cost of

374
00:19:57.801 --> 00:20:01.550
infrastructure and all of these trickle down effects that weren't really

375
00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:04.280
conceived of before. You know, when they put this rule in place,

376
00:20:04.281 --> 00:20:07.370
they weren't trying to say infrastructure in the north has to be extraordinarily

377
00:20:07.371 --> 00:20:10.130
expensive. They're just trying to get everyone to have sunlight.

378
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.210
And so he came in and sort of noted some of those rules and said like,

379
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:18.290
this is actually hindering development in these places because this is a limit

380
00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:19.850
that is not going to work out.

381
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.440
<v 1>So in more market-based economies that probably most people nowadays are</v>

382
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.930
more likely to live in or be familiar with.

383
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.770
What is the role of an urban planner? What do they actually do?

384
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:32.210
<v 0>Well,</v>

385
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:37.190
I think Alain would say that historically urban planners in

386
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:41.690
non centrally planned economies still think of themselves as central planners,

387
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.490
even if they don't explicitly say so they still think that if they put a rule in

388
00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:46.821
place,

389
00:20:46.821 --> 00:20:51.250
it will be followed and it'll work out the way they're imagining as opposed to

390
00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:55.930
thinking of it as a dynamic system that will react to the rules and sort of mold

391
00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:59.140
itself in a way that has a lot of unintended consequences.

392
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.330
So I guess there are a lot of urban planners still that think of

393
00:21:04.331 --> 00:21:08.080
themselves as architects who can like shape a city in exactly the form they

394
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:11.560
want. Something like a Disneyland, but I think Alain would say,

395
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:15.610
and I would strongly agree that urban planners should think of themselves more

396
00:21:15.611 --> 00:21:19.840
as like protocol creators in the way that a software engineer might design a

397
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:22.000
protocol, but not say everything on top.

398
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.350
So TCP/IP is a brilliant design because it's not that

399
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.184
opinionated,

400
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.220
it's only opinionated about the things that need to happen to help people

401
00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:35.020
coordinate. So a city that I think has done this really well is New York City.

402
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.330
In, I believe it was 1811,

403
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:42.640
the city put together a master plan that laid out the grid that we

404
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:44.740
all know today of, you know, streets and avenues.

405
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:48.280
And you can actually see which parts of the city were created before.

406
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:50.620
That plan was in place in the Southern tip of Manhattan.

407
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.850
They're all this warren of streets that is, I think, beautiful,

408
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:57.250
but also quite messy and like hard to get around.

409
00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.730
But then everything north of that is a grid very,

410
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:05.680
very precise and something that the New York City plan did really well,

411
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.210
I think is make it very clear from the get-go what was public land and what was

412
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:13.630
private land. So instead of saying, we're going to control everything,

413
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:14.770
or instead of saying,

414
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.120
we're going to let everyone just like be anarchists and do whatever they want.

415
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:18.850
They said,

416
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:22.330
we need to define rights of way because people need to be able to get around

417
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:27.580
when you to keep space for like sewage and other sanitation systems that we all

418
00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:31.750
need. Like no one wants poop in the streets and we're going to define spaces for

419
00:22:31.751 --> 00:22:34.180
public parks. That's why central park is so big.

420
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:38.320
They just carved it out before anyone actually started developing there.

421
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.070
And then they left everything else to the market to decide.

422
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.380
And I think this works really well because it enabled the key methods of

423
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:51.550
coordination that people needed while also leaving space for people to be

424
00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:55.390
creative and to make their own idea of what the city should be.

425
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.070
<v 1>And New York, I think many would feel, as the city,</v>

426
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.550
a cultural powerhouse, a place people love to visit,

427
00:23:02.551 --> 00:23:04.440
and many people love to live.

428
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.550
Maybe it's also incredibly dense and incredibly expensive and dirty,

429
00:23:08.551 --> 00:23:11.790
and all those negative things you associated with the collection of people that

430
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:16.350
is cities, but nevertheless, truly the prototype city in some ways.

431
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.240
<v 0>And it's been an engine to pull people out of poverty for hundreds of years,</v>

432
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.400
like immigrants have landed in New York and poor Americans have ended up in New

433
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.270
York. Black people ended up in New York after the reconstruction.

434
00:23:30.271 --> 00:23:34.950
And they found this place where they had more opportunities and they were able

435
00:23:34.951 --> 00:23:37.980
to like build themselves up. And like, it has a lot of flaws,

436
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:42.240
but it's something that enabled both the coordination while also remain keeping

437
00:23:42.241 --> 00:23:44.850
space for people to make their own lives, what they wanted it to be.

438
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:49.130
And I think it's just been one of the greatest engines of progress in America.

439
00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:52.700
And I know that sounds really melodramatic, but I stand by it.

440
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.460
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

441
00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.350
<v 2>No for sure. All the more significant than that,</v>

442
00:23:56.351 --> 00:24:01.120
we've conducted this sort of quiet experiment on rolling back market dynamics in

443
00:24:01.121 --> 00:24:05.020
American cities over the past, call it 60 or 70 years. You know, like you said,

444
00:24:05.021 --> 00:24:08.080
it used to be that you basically do whatever you want if you had private

445
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.880
property. Now,

446
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.060
the model is like in San Francisco with which we're both familiar with it,

447
00:24:13.061 --> 00:24:14.740
you basically can't do anything to a first approximation.

448
00:24:14.741 --> 00:24:16.180
Everything is set forever, don't change it.

449
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.640
And I think we're only now starting to see the consequences of that

450
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.460
experiment and to evaluate how well it did or didn't work.

451
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.460
<v 0>Totally. And it's a very complicated issue.</v>

452
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:31.750
So one of the reasons I left San Francisco was this growing feeling that you're

453
00:24:31.751 --> 00:24:34.840
just like not allowed to do things there anymore. And for me,

454
00:24:34.841 --> 00:24:36.220
what that meant concretely was like,

455
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.120
I was very active in housing policy because I wanted to San Francisco to build

456
00:24:40.121 --> 00:24:40.840
more housing.

457
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.010
So more people could move there and have access to the awesome opportunities

458
00:24:45.011 --> 00:24:48.400
that the tech industry has offered and other industries as well.

459
00:24:48.401 --> 00:24:51.760
But the tech being the primary one and after several years,

460
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.820
but I just kind of got a little down about it and didn't feel like we were

461
00:24:54.821 --> 00:24:58.660
making much progress because San Francisco has very strict zoning laws.

462
00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.520
It has a very granular,

463
00:25:00.521 --> 00:25:05.350
local control where neighbors can stop projects in their tracks that are near

464
00:25:05.351 --> 00:25:07.540
them or really anywhere in the city.

465
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.290
But it has a really complex history because the place that it comes from is

466
00:25:11.291 --> 00:25:15.190
actually a place I agree with. And then I think it's just gone too far.

467
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:19.990
So the place that that's come from is in the 50s and 60s,

468
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:25.240
American cities all over the country built many highways and the way they built

469
00:25:25.241 --> 00:25:28.990
these highways was they primarily tore down African-American communities,

470
00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.020
other communities of color as well, primarily African-American communities.

471
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.870
And they just did it without really asking.

472
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.600
They would just bulldoze an entire neighborhood.

473
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.130
<v 1>Was this eminent domain, or?</v>

474
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.760
<v 0>It was through a variety of different methods. Some of it was eminent domain.</v>

475
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.380
Yeah. And there were a number of different ways that they could do this.

476
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.930
And like each city had a slightly different approach.

477
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.800
The effect was that like these highways would just cut through these communities

478
00:25:53.801 --> 00:25:54.940
and destroy them.

479
00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.810
So there were these things called the highway revolts that started happening in

480
00:25:58.811 --> 00:26:02.410
the sixties where people were saying, Hey, you're destroying my life.

481
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.150
That's not okay. You can't do that.

482
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.740
And one of the ways that San Francisco reacted was putting rules in place to

483
00:26:08.741 --> 00:26:13.510
make it easier for locals to defend their neighborhoods and to have a voice in

484
00:26:13.511 --> 00:26:15.970
the process, which I think is a very good goal to have.

485
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:20.860
But where that has ended up is that today one of the specific tools that was put

486
00:26:20.861 --> 00:26:22.870
in place is something called discretionary review.

487
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:27.940
And discretionary review basically says that if you have an issue with a project

488
00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.930
as a resident of the city, you can like file a complaint and stop it,

489
00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.280
or at least force it to pause and have a hearing about the project.

490
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.580
And in theory, that was supposed to be used by, you know,

491
00:26:39.581 --> 00:26:42.250
people who were getting their houses bulldozed so that a highway could go

492
00:26:42.251 --> 00:26:43.920
through or whatever, you know,

493
00:26:43.921 --> 00:26:47.970
someone's putting up like a really loud factory next to you or something like

494
00:26:47.971 --> 00:26:48.600
that.

495
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.530
But practically the way it's used today is that like really wealthy people who

496
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:54.540
live in Pac Heights, Pacific Heights,

497
00:26:54.541 --> 00:26:57.930
which is a neighborhood in San Francisco will like complain about how their

498
00:26:57.931 --> 00:26:58.351
neighbor,

499
00:26:58.351 --> 00:27:02.670
who's building a two-story house is putting a shadow in their vegetable garden.

500
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.240
And you know, like you don't want to shadow in your vegetable garden. I get it.

501
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.520
But my personal opinion is that making it possible for a family to move in

502
00:27:11.521 --> 00:27:14.400
next to you is like way more important than if your squash gets sunlight.

503
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.830
So it's this tool that ended up going so far as to give people local control

504
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:22.620
that like completely blocked the system. And as a result,

505
00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.390
San Francisco has added far more jobs than it has housing for the

506
00:27:27.391 --> 00:27:29.130
last, like 10 years straight.

507
00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.970
And the housing prices just have completely shot up. Anyway,

508
00:27:32.971 --> 00:27:34.530
I shouldn't rant about that way too much,

509
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.430
but the point is that it's a really complex issue where there's always a balance

510
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:43.290
between local control and also maximizing sort of for the greater good and

511
00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:46.620
for the greater good is like a really complicated concept to define.

512
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.220
<v 1>Yeah or, as you mentioned earlier,</v>

513
00:27:49.221 --> 00:27:53.000
with the art deco buildings where there's heritage to protect,

514
00:27:53.001 --> 00:27:56.420
you want to protect the character of a place that makes it unique and special

515
00:27:56.421 --> 00:27:59.810
and not just tear it all down and replace it with highways and strip malls,

516
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:04.010
which may be sometimes pure economic forces would take you in this homogenizing

517
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:04.791
direction,

518
00:28:04.791 --> 00:28:08.480
which I think is also part of the argument against quote unquote gentrification,

519
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.020
which is a big big talk back here in Berlin. These days,

520
00:28:12.021 --> 00:28:13.580
a lot of demonstrations and things.

521
00:28:13.581 --> 00:28:16.760
There was a five-year rent cap law that had been passed.

522
00:28:16.761 --> 00:28:18.680
And it was struck down by the German Supreme court.

523
00:28:18.681 --> 00:28:23.390
It's a real huge point of debate between the people who are here already

524
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.330
and want things to basically stay the way they are.

525
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.690
They want to preserve the character of the city, which I agree is very special,

526
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:34.880
but then life has changed and the city should grow just like all things

527
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.860
grow and change to be healthy.

528
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:40.250
In addition to just the simple fact that we're adding more humans to the planet.

529
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.550
And if we're going to have more humans then we also need more houses for those

530
00:28:43.551 --> 00:28:44.420
humans to be in.

531
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.190
And just because you were there first doesn't necessarily give you special

532
00:28:49.191 --> 00:28:52.190
privileges for housing as opposed to the needs of others.

533
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.634
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

534
00:28:53.151 --> 00:28:57.530
The rent controls issues is a really interesting one because I understand where

535
00:28:57.531 --> 00:28:58.191
it comes from,

536
00:28:58.191 --> 00:29:02.780
which is we don't want people to get displaced when the place around them

537
00:29:02.781 --> 00:29:06.560
becomes more expensive. But at the same time, when you have rent control,

538
00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:11.780
I think it's akin to aristocracy in the sense of

539
00:29:11.781 --> 00:29:14.900
saying like you got here first, this is like your land.

540
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.060
You have some special privilege over it.

541
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:22.310
And newcomers who may also want to make their life better and may also want to

542
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.160
have access to what that beautiful city has to offer.

543
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.820
Now don't have access and like sympathetic to the goal of locals,

544
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.630
locals being in a position where they can stay in their home.

545
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.220
And I think that is a problem to solve,

546
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.820
but rent controls are a very blunt instrument that don't actually quite do.

547
00:29:37.821 --> 00:29:40.070
The thing that people say that it should do.

548
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.400
Rent control is a tricky situation because it encourages things like landlords

549
00:29:45.401 --> 00:29:48.100
neglecting to actually take care of the building.

550
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.690
I think there's other ways to achieve the same results that are also not

551
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:55.390
perfect, but result in fewer issues.

552
00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:00.040
One final thought on that is like rent control also increases the price

553
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.360
for other people who weren't lucky enough to be in a rent controlled building.

554
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.740
So Berlin for instance, has a lot of immigrants who are coming in,

555
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.850
who I think should have a home and should be welcomed,

556
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.570
but because they weren't in a building at the time of rent control,

557
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.420
they're now forced to the outskirts of the city,

558
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.320
or they're forced to pay a lot more for the remaining buildings that are not

559
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:27.760
rent controlled because it's rent control effectively removing supply from the

560
00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:28.594
market.

561
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.900
It just sort of puts everything in stasis and people don't want to move from

562
00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:35.350
places, even if they need to upgrade and I'm sympathetic to the goal,

563
00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:39.430
but we have to look at like the outcome of what actually happens when you put

564
00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:41.830
something in place, not just say what you wish it did.

565
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:47.070
<v 1>Some of that sounds like sort of understanding market dynamics or</v>

566
00:30:47.071 --> 00:30:47.904
economics.

567
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.010
And that reminds me of another thrust of Order Without Design,

568
00:30:53.011 --> 00:30:56.460
which is, he's basically talking about urban economists,

569
00:30:56.461 --> 00:31:00.930
which is essentially the academic study of cities and then urban

570
00:31:00.931 --> 00:31:03.450
planners, which in fact was what his job is,

571
00:31:03.451 --> 00:31:08.070
which is people whose work for governments in some form to figure out things

572
00:31:08.071 --> 00:31:12.690
like zoning laws in an attempt to shepherd the city in whatever direction

573
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.960
the government would like it to go. And he talks about that,

574
00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:17.760
at least at the time this book was written,

575
00:31:17.761 --> 00:31:20.400
they didn't have good communication with each other.

576
00:31:20.401 --> 00:31:25.380
So planners might be not that aware of economics and kind

577
00:31:25.381 --> 00:31:27.090
of market dynamics generally,

578
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:31.860
but then also the very specific dynamics of the role of markets in

579
00:31:31.861 --> 00:31:33.840
cities. And of course, vice versa as well.

580
00:31:33.841 --> 00:31:37.560
The academics are a little disconnected from the reality of the decisions that

581
00:31:37.561 --> 00:31:39.270
the planners need to make every day.

582
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.470
<v 0>Totally. And some of those realities are political realities.</v>

583
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:45.990
Like what we were just talking about with rent control.

584
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.190
People do not feel good when they see what they consider gentrification

585
00:31:50.191 --> 00:31:50.910
happening,

586
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.940
or when they feel like they're being priced out of the neighborhood that they've

587
00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:54.900
lived for their whole life.

588
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.470
And so they get angry and they want something to be done.

589
00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.880
And the problem is that doing something doesn't always make the problem better,

590
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.250
doing something sometimes actually makes the problem worse.

591
00:32:05.251 --> 00:32:08.340
If you don't understand the causal model of what's going to go on.

592
00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:12.690
And so there's been a lot of actions that people take that I think actually

593
00:32:12.691 --> 00:32:17.670
worsen the situation to their own goals because they don't appreciate the

594
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:22.260
level of dynamicism that's happening. So like a similar example,

595
00:32:22.261 --> 00:32:23.310
it's not about cities,

596
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.690
but it's sort of similar dynamic economic system is like taxes.

597
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:29.070
Since moving to Florida,

598
00:32:29.071 --> 00:32:33.060
I've met a lot of people who have moved to Florida from New York and California

599
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:38.040
because New York and California have been hiking up taxes for companies and for

600
00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:39.120
themselves individually.

601
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:44.450
And I will not make any judgment about whether I agree or disagree with

602
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:47.870
that. But just to make the point that like when you increase taxes,

603
00:32:47.871 --> 00:32:51.140
people will find ways to not pay them often. Not always,

604
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.410
but it is a reality that you have to deal with and you can't just like moralize

605
00:32:54.411 --> 00:32:55.160
it and say, oh well,

606
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.550
they're bad people for not paying the taxes that the society around them agreed

607
00:32:58.551 --> 00:33:00.770
upon. You have to actually deal with the problem.

608
00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.420
And so I think a lot of governments will raise taxes and then be shocked that

609
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:09.230
like they get a lot less revenue than they expect because people just move away.

610
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.900
And so cities often have similar issues. Like for instance,

611
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:19.790
there's something called a privately owned public open space in San Francisco.

612
00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:22.400
And I believe New York and a number of other cities have this too.

613
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.790
And the concept is you're a big developer,

614
00:33:25.791 --> 00:33:28.970
you're building like an office building or a bunch of condos or apartments or

615
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:29.804
something.

616
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:34.550
And the privately owned public open spaces is POPOS is the acronym.

617
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.450
It's a rule that says, if you build a development of a certain size,

618
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.800
you have to build at least this much public space for people to enjoy in the

619
00:33:42.801 --> 00:33:44.960
building. Sounds like a really nice idea.

620
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:46.640
And some of them actually are really nice.

621
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:49.970
Like there's this really beautiful cafe in the LinkedIn building in San

622
00:33:49.971 --> 00:33:51.500
Francisco, that is a POPO,

623
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:56.720
but there's a lot of other POPOs that are sort of hidden because the

624
00:33:56.721 --> 00:33:59.420
developer sees the letter of the law and they say, oh,

625
00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:01.550
but they didn't say like where it needs to be.

626
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.750
And so sometimes they'll put these POPOs on like the rooftop of the building and

627
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:08.390
put like no signage whatsoever for people to find it.

628
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.600
And so it's effectively just a private space for the building. And, you know,

629
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.210
it's a nice amenity. Maybe the people who live in that building like it,

630
00:34:14.211 --> 00:34:14.571
whatever,

631
00:34:14.571 --> 00:34:19.250
but it's not solving the problem that the government wanted to

632
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:23.630
solve when they put that rule in place. And so something that complexifies this,

633
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:28.370
is that politicians and bureaucrats usually get points for starting something,

634
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.080
but not for the actual results.

635
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.680
And so if they say we did something to create more public space in San

636
00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:36.230
Francisco, people clap and like reelect them,

637
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:38.870
but then five years down the line you realize like, oh,

638
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:42.800
there is no extra public space really. These are really hard to get to.

639
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.170
And people have to put together like special maps.

640
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.420
There's all these like lists online that you can find.

641
00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:49.940
And there are all these like secret little nooks, which is, you know,

642
00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:52.610
fun in its own, right. But really not what the city was going for.

643
00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:57.340
<v 1>I think accountability loops is one of the biggest things missing in</v>

644
00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.860
public policy debate or politics.

645
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.640
And I don't necessarily think anyone's quite to blame there it's a systematic

646
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.550
thing, but it's something where when a project like that is set up,

647
00:35:06.551 --> 00:35:09.790
we don't even define what success is necessarily. We say,

648
00:35:09.791 --> 00:35:14.590
we're going to do a project to change our spaces somehow more public space,

649
00:35:14.591 --> 00:35:17.140
more greenery, different transit options,

650
00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:21.010
but what will success be and how we measure that five years down the road.

651
00:35:21.011 --> 00:35:25.810
And if it's not working we'll pivot or transition or sunset the program,

652
00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.450
but that's rarely the way the government works.

653
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.800
<v 0>Yeah. I couldn't agree more. And I think it's doable.</v>

654
00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:37.150
A lot of organizations do this all the time and I'm sure that some government

655
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:38.310
organizations do as well,

656
00:35:38.311 --> 00:35:42.330
but it doesn't usually loop back to the voters.

657
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.450
And I still don't have a clear model of why that is,

658
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.980
but I think it's a really important problem to solve because in the situation

659
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:53.370
that we're in now, without that accountability loop,

660
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.270
politicians who even want to do the right thing will have a hard time doing it

661
00:35:57.271 --> 00:36:00.840
because they'll spend all their time doing the right thing and not like doing

662
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:03.030
the flashy things and then they won't get reelected.

663
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.740
And so they'll only have their,

664
00:36:04.741 --> 00:36:08.220
what two or four year stints or whatever it is before they're booted out.

665
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:10.410
And you can only have so much impact in that time.

666
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.100
So building those loops is really important.

667
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.060
And I think I've seen some cities like Singapore, for example,

668
00:36:18.061 --> 00:36:19.950
have like dashboards with certain statistics,

669
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:22.320
which I think are an interesting start,

670
00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:27.780
but it's certainly not normal like a normal practice and not something

671
00:36:27.781 --> 00:36:29.160
that more people are aware of.

672
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:32.580
And like no person wants to create a system where they now have to be

673
00:36:32.581 --> 00:36:36.720
accountable because now it only increases the chance that they won't succeed at

674
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:41.700
the goal. So something that has to be imposed and actually before that,

675
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:44.880
even it's even hard to even agree what the goals should be right.

676
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.540
So like in the instance of historical preservation we were talking about,

677
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.780
different cities have made very different trade-offs. Uh,

678
00:36:51.781 --> 00:36:56.190
but individuals within those cities all disagree really strongly. So like Paris,

679
00:36:56.191 --> 00:36:59.550
for example, has effectively decided to be kind of like a living museum.

680
00:36:59.551 --> 00:37:04.440
There's rules like you're not allowed to build buildings that go

681
00:37:04.441 --> 00:37:09.060
above a particular line relative to sea level so that you can have a good view

682
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:10.320
of, I can't remember which church,

683
00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:12.720
but like a particular church on a hill that's just gorgeous.

684
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.490
<v 2>Is that Notre Dame? Or am I imagining that?</v>

685
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.260
<v 0>No, I don't think it's Notre Dame.</v>

686
00:37:16.261 --> 00:37:20.520
I think it's the one on the hill with a really beautiful view of like, uh,

687
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.570
has like this. Like I can picture it in my head, but it's not coming to me,

688
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.370
but it's gorgeous.

689
00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:29.250
And you're supposed to have a view of it from roughly everywhere in the city.

690
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.530
And that's a choice to make, you know,

691
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.920
but the result is that Paris is extremely expensive,

692
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:36.780
especially for Parisians.

693
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:41.790
And a lot of people end up having to move to the outskirts or similarly,

694
00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:46.380
like it's tough to have a large headquarters for a business in Paris

695
00:37:46.381 --> 00:37:48.570
because there just aren't that many big buildings.

696
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.370
So they've created this whole new business district called La Défense,

697
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:57.360
which is like way off in the outskirts and like nowhere near the core of the

698
00:37:57.361 --> 00:37:59.370
city, which has big skyscrapers.

699
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:01.770
And like there's a trade-off that Paris chose to make.

700
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.200
And I think it has hurt their economy,

701
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:09.450
but it has like preserved this gem of a city that I'm super happy, exists.

702
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.020
And I'm like really glad that I can go and look at these beautiful views and

703
00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:13.980
beautiful architecture.

704
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:19.080
So every city needs to make those choices itself and

705
00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.560
there will always be people who are benefiting and hurting from it.

706
00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.750
And it makes it really hard.

707
00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.670
<v 1>One example of kind of preserving what's there living museum, like you said,</v>

708
00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.430
versus investing in the future,

709
00:38:33.431 --> 00:38:37.870
which sometimes means taking risks was the building, the Eiffel tower. Uh,

710
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.190
I read a great, uh,

711
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:43.960
biography of Gustave Eiffel who's a pretty inspiring fellow,

712
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.730
but did quite a lot of work. Um, but the Statue of Liberty and the, um,

713
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:52.090
or the internals of the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel tower being two of his

714
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:56.420
more famous pieces, uh, but, when, you know, when they put up plans to,

715
00:38:56.421 --> 00:39:00.910
to build that for, I think it was a world's fair. The outrage in the city was,

716
00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.190
was huge. And even immediately after it was built,

717
00:39:03.191 --> 00:39:08.110
the feeling was it's this eyesore dominates the skyline.

718
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:12.790
It's this super modern thing that doesn't fit with our, um, you know, quaint,

719
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.670
uh, quaint architectural vibe. Um,

720
00:39:16.671 --> 00:39:19.540
and it took a long time before it became what it is now,

721
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:23.830
which is this total icon that not only stands for Paris, but in fact for France.

722
00:39:23.831 --> 00:39:26.380
And he couldn't couldn't even imagine it without that,

723
00:39:26.381 --> 00:39:31.000
but that was a bold move that a lot of people were, um, were against.

724
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.170
And so in order to,

725
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:35.320
in order to build that next Eiffel tower or whatever that's going to be,

726
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.860
you need to be willing to take risks, but then that comes at a cost.

727
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:42.300
<v 0>Yeah. I think that's such a good example. And I mean,</v>

728
00:39:42.301 --> 00:39:46.200
I think I should probably express that my bias here is I like building things

729
00:39:46.201 --> 00:39:49.500
and I like taking risks and like seeing other people take risks.

730
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.100
And so I like to live in a place that allows that.

731
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.800
That's one of the reasons I moved to Miami from San Francisco is it,

732
00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.560
it feels like it's more welcome here. And like, you know,

733
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.890
Paris seems like an even more extreme version of San Francisco,

734
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:06.120
but I also respect the idea of a community coming in,

735
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:08.430
making that decision to make the opposite choice,

736
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.730
but it becomes really challenging to decide like,

737
00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.100
what does it mean for the community to make the decision?

738
00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.980
Because it's hard enough to even know what one individual wants.

739
00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:20.070
I think let alone to capture the views of everyone.

740
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.870
The most common form of voting for instance is like first pass the post,

741
00:40:24.871 --> 00:40:29.820
or whoever gets the majority rule vote. And that works,

742
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:31.170
it's like better than a lot of things,

743
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:35.010
but it has a number of really important flaws. Like for example,

744
00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.760
what if the majority of people kind of like the Eiffel tower,

745
00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.450
but a minority hates it and they think it's the worst thing ever.

746
00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.150
So there's a majority that weakly would like it,

747
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:48.210
but also they don't care that much if you don't have it and they voted in,

748
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:51.270
but then there's a minority who's like totally harmed by it. To me, like,

749
00:40:51.271 --> 00:40:54.450
if you had that distribution of preferences,

750
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.230
I would actually prefer not to build it because like it's harming people

751
00:40:58.231 --> 00:41:01.680
extremely in a way that no one is actually benefiting from that much.

752
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:02.491
But you know,

753
00:41:02.491 --> 00:41:06.150
that's the values question and like designing these systems is the values thing.

754
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:10.380
And I think every single voting system has like some very valid criticism that

755
00:41:10.381 --> 00:41:11.214
you could have.

756
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.910
So it's not clear even how communities should make these choices,

757
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.620
which brings us back to markets,

758
00:41:16.621 --> 00:41:21.150
which I think is like something I really like about having every city make

759
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.960
decisions differently and having a little more decentralization where, you know,

760
00:41:24.961 --> 00:41:27.360
a central government, like the particular country,

761
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:31.800
isn't making all the rules because then every city can come to its own decision

762
00:41:31.801 --> 00:41:32.730
about how to make decisions,

763
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:38.270
and you can end up like leaving places and making choices for yourself if you

764
00:41:38.271 --> 00:41:43.190
disagree with that particular place. And so by allowing diversity,

765
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.830
it's going to create more situations that you personally disagree with,

766
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.520
but it also create more situations that you really love and you can go live

767
00:41:49.521 --> 00:41:53.870
there. And so diversity is really crucial, I think, to solving this problem.

768
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.320
And then the other piece is people have to be able to actually move.

769
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.220
And that's really hard, you know, in a world with a lot of borders,

770
00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:04.240
there's actually quite limited choices for most people in the world.

771
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.780
<v 1>I'm a huge fan of let a thousand flowers bloom,</v>

772
00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:12.640
and then individual choice to kind of have a bottom up emergence of what's

773
00:42:12.641 --> 00:42:16.150
working or what is in turn natural sorting. But you're absolutely right.

774
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:18.880
The world that we live in, that's built on nation states,

775
00:42:18.881 --> 00:42:22.240
which sort of assume you're born in a place and you probably live your entire

776
00:42:22.241 --> 00:42:26.080
life without going more than about a hundred kilometers from that place.

777
00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.210
And you have kids there and you die there.

778
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.430
That's what I think a lot of the sort of national systems and immigration and

779
00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.250
customs systems that we have now are kind of assuming.

780
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.580
But I think that has not been the case for awhile and that's going to become

781
00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:43.750
even more so with a lot of mass migration in the near future.

782
00:42:43.751 --> 00:42:46.900
And certainly for those of us privileged enough to be in the tech world where we

783
00:42:46.901 --> 00:42:49.930
have disposable income and choice of where we want to work,

784
00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.210
perhaps because we're on remote teams.

785
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.690
It is really the case just as I decided to go to another country,

786
00:42:55.691 --> 00:42:58.690
not because I wanted to go to another country so specifically,

787
00:42:58.691 --> 00:43:02.440
but because the city I wanted happened to be located in that other country,

788
00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:07.420
I ran up against very much, still do run up against all the challenges,

789
00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.440
the significant challenges of being an immigrant and quite a lot of it is

790
00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:14.290
related to this assumption that people don't move.

791
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:18.040
<v 0>Yeah. And I think growing up in a country like the United States,</v>

792
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.800
you have a lot of options because it's a really big country,

793
00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.500
so you can move a lot of places. But honestly,

794
00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:26.470
even that is very limiting to grow up without a lot of money.

795
00:43:26.471 --> 00:43:30.040
It's hard to move to San Francisco because it's an expensive place. And like,

796
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.160
sure, you might be able to get a job with a high salary once you're there,

797
00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:36.430
but it's going to take time and you don't know, you haven't been there.

798
00:43:36.431 --> 00:43:37.840
Maybe you can't get jobs who knows.

799
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:41.860
So a lot of people are stopped by that as well, but in a smaller country,

800
00:43:41.861 --> 00:43:43.960
like again, Argentina is one that I know really well.

801
00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:45.730
There's one really big city.

802
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.880
It's Buenos Aires and a third of the country lives in that city.

803
00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.950
There's a lot of other cool places to be too.

804
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.320
But Buenos Aires is the place you want to go,

805
00:43:53.321 --> 00:43:56.740
if you want to have like a really ambitious career and you know,

806
00:43:56.741 --> 00:44:00.130
if you don't like Buenos Aires tough luck, like it's tough, you know,

807
00:44:00.131 --> 00:44:02.350
it's a beautiful city. A lot of people do love it.

808
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.390
But if you want something else from your life,

809
00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:08.470
you want to be a Hollywood movie star. You now have to get a visa.

810
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:12.640
You have to like uproot your entire life and move to a whole nother country on a

811
00:44:12.641 --> 00:44:13.474
different continent.

812
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:18.100
And so I think it's something that we're going to have to find new models for it

813
00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:22.570
because what's happening now locks a lot of people out of opportunities.

814
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.060
And I think it's honestly a moral issue.

815
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.740
There's people who live in places with very little opportunity and they

816
00:44:29.741 --> 00:44:33.200
themselves have a lot of potential but they're stuck somewhere that has poor

817
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:35.940
systems of coordination and they just can't get out.

818
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.550
And so we're going to need to find new models for that,

819
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:40.950
but I don't have solutions I'm just criticizing at this point.

820
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:43.850
<v 2>Yeah. The mobility question is really tough.</v>

821
00:44:43.851 --> 00:44:47.720
To what extent do governments have a heightened obligation to their current

822
00:44:47.721 --> 00:44:50.960
citizens versus future ones who might yet be born there? It might move there.

823
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:52.520
That's a really tough question. I don't know.

824
00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:56.930
I don't think there's an easy answer, but looking within an existing polity,

825
00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:01.850
I think our discussion of voting and markets was really circling around the crux

826
00:45:01.851 --> 00:45:02.570
of the issue.

827
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:07.070
The reason I think cities are so hard and potentially so much more valuable

828
00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:11.300
is you have this mix of public and private impact.

829
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.900
So by public and private, I mean, a private good is something that you kind of,

830
00:45:14.901 --> 00:45:18.800
you yourself purely consume and the effect only touches you.

831
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.130
Like if you consume a pencil or something, you know, by consume, I mean,

832
00:45:22.131 --> 00:45:24.890
like you write with it. That basically only affects you.

833
00:45:24.891 --> 00:45:27.410
It doesn't really affect your neighbor. It's a totally private good.

834
00:45:27.411 --> 00:45:30.560
And totally public good, an example might be national defense,

835
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:33.050
it's like everyone in the country gets it or no one gets it.

836
00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.090
That's not exactly true, but that's a good,

837
00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:39.170
it's basically purely for the benefit of the group as a whole.

838
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.200
The thing about cities is you get this really messy mix.

839
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.880
So to go back to your example Devon,

840
00:45:43.881 --> 00:45:47.090
of building a two-story building in a previously one story lot,

841
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.180
there's a huge chunk of private benefit. You get space for the family.

842
00:45:50.181 --> 00:45:54.980
And there's all kinds of other secondary public impacts like there's shadow and

843
00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:57.170
there's noise and there's traffic.

844
00:45:57.171 --> 00:45:59.780
And then you're consuming some of this precious lumber off the market and

845
00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.190
there's all this kind of stuff going on.

846
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.630
And I think the issue we have with cities is we only have a few relatively

847
00:46:05.631 --> 00:46:10.310
primitive technologies for distributed decision making and coordination.

848
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.070
We have first past the post voting,

849
00:46:13.071 --> 00:46:17.540
we have corresponding representatives with that model and we have call it

850
00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:18.800
laissez faire economics.

851
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:22.220
And the pure economic model works really well for private goods.

852
00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.020
And the pure voting model can work well in cases where we have a single

853
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.210
public good that everyone cares equally about,

854
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.800
but we don't really have the social technology to address this mess in the

855
00:46:33.801 --> 00:46:37.610
middle. And that's why I feel like we end up with so much issues with cities.

856
00:46:37.611 --> 00:46:40.040
And then the flip side of that is I think there's enormous potential on the

857
00:46:40.041 --> 00:46:40.401
upside.

858
00:46:40.401 --> 00:46:44.030
If we have a coordination technology that reflects the underlying reality

859
00:46:44.031 --> 00:46:46.340
better, we could get into a much better spot with cities.

860
00:46:46.341 --> 00:46:49.070
I'm still optimistic that we'll figure something like that out.

861
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:53.540
<v 0>I think that's really well put. And that actually clarifies a lot for me,</v>

862
00:46:53.541 --> 00:46:56.150
honestly, that space in the middle is really challenging.

863
00:46:56.151 --> 00:47:00.140
And I think right now we have these massive oversimplifications where we just

864
00:47:00.141 --> 00:47:02.720
pretend like they're private goods or we just pretend like they're public goods.

865
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:04.610
And they're really not, they're a mix.

866
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.770
And so I think one of the reasons why we haven't had more innovation in those

867
00:47:09.771 --> 00:47:13.850
sorts of coordination mechanisms for things in the middle is that there's a

868
00:47:13.851 --> 00:47:18.380
limited amount of land and it's really hard to just start

869
00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:21.710
fresh. Like there's kind of no frontier anymore, on Earth at least.

870
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:26.030
And also in combination with that for the land that does exist,

871
00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:30.010
the people in power would have to agree that we try a new system,

872
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:34.480
which would probably lessen their power. And so they never want to give it up.

873
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.351
And like, you know,

874
00:47:35.351 --> 00:47:37.780
if I was in power maybe I wouldn't want to give it up either. I don't know.

875
00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:39.940
Like I think I have some pretty good ideas.

876
00:47:39.941 --> 00:47:41.560
So of course I should have the power, right?

877
00:47:41.561 --> 00:47:43.090
Like I think that a lot of people have that view.

878
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:46.600
So it doesn't make them bad people or selfish necessarily,

879
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.570
but just why would I give up control that I have.

880
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.620
Some concepts that I've been really excited about that are a bit out there,

881
00:47:53.621 --> 00:47:58.450
but I think are really important for us to take seriously are

882
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:03.550
the idea of building new cities and three projects in particular have come

883
00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:06.250
to mind. One is seasteading if you've heard of that,

884
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:11.500
which is the concept of like building floating cities in the oceans effectively

885
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:16.300
creating new land where there wasn't any before a second one is charter cities,

886
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:21.280
which is the idea of carving out land in a place that already exists

887
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.610
and creating sort of a special economic zone,

888
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:29.500
much like how Shenzhen in China was a new experimental city that ended up

889
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.560
dramatically changing the way that all of China works. Ultimately, because,

890
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:34.000
so some background,

891
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:39.430
Shenzhen is this part of China where several decades ago they carved out this

892
00:48:39.431 --> 00:48:41.110
place and they said, we're going to like,

893
00:48:41.170 --> 00:48:44.290
kind of experiment with capitalism here. We're going to see if it works.

894
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.750
And it worked, like really well,

895
00:48:46.751 --> 00:48:49.240
according to the metrics that the Chinese government cared about.

896
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.420
And so they started adopting those across the rest of China as well.

897
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.290
So charter cities are kind of like taking that idea and scaling it to more

898
00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:56.290
places.

899
00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:00.730
And the third one is a lot of people are really interested in the idea of going

900
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:04.480
to space and going to Mars. And I don't actually know a ton about that.

901
00:49:04.481 --> 00:49:08.110
That seems really hard, but I think that comes from this place of people saying,

902
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:10.270
you know, there's no blank slate anymore,

903
00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.540
and it's really hard to change these kinds of things and systems that already

904
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:13.961
exist.

905
00:49:13.961 --> 00:49:18.580
So where are the places that we can create new land or create space to run these

906
00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:21.730
experiments? I think all of these are really, far-fetched like,

907
00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.700
I'm not sure if any of these experiments will work. I mean,

908
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.210
I think charter cities have the most potential given that they worked in the

909
00:49:28.211 --> 00:49:32.950
past with places like Shenzhen or Dubai in some senses was a special economic

910
00:49:32.951 --> 00:49:33.784
zone.

911
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.650
But I think the experimentation is where you get these new ideas and you develop

912
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:40.060
confidence that they might work.

913
00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:40.981
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

914
00:49:40.981 --> 00:49:44.940
And I have some optimism that we'll see experimentation in those types of new

915
00:49:44.941 --> 00:49:45.774
cities.

916
00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:50.700
I'm also very bullish on experimentation with land-like places in the

917
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:56.100
non-physical world. So one example that I can kind of run through is spectrum.

918
00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.140
So electromagnetic spectrum,

919
00:49:58.141 --> 00:50:01.140
you need a slice of it to be able to communicate over the airwaves.

920
00:50:01.141 --> 00:50:05.730
Basically things like radio and WiFi go over this and it's kinda like land and

921
00:50:05.731 --> 00:50:09.840
that's sliced up and it's sold or licensed currently by the relevant regulatory

922
00:50:09.841 --> 00:50:10.674
authority.

923
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:14.640
And it has a lot of the same challenges that we see with regular land.

924
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:18.540
Whereas if, for example, you have naive, pure private property. You could,

925
00:50:18.541 --> 00:50:18.991
for example,

926
00:50:18.991 --> 00:50:23.910
say someone buys the slice of spectrum for WiFi a hundred years

927
00:50:23.911 --> 00:50:27.380
ago, and then someone else develops WiFi. Well,

928
00:50:27.381 --> 00:50:31.520
the person who owns that WiFi slice just got massively rich by no work of their

929
00:50:31.521 --> 00:50:34.790
own. Right? That's really wealth that doesn't in any way, belong to them.

930
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:37.940
And in fact, they can now not be a particularly good owner of it,

931
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:40.280
but perhaps for financial tax reasons, they don't want to sell it,

932
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.270
so on and so forth.

933
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:45.680
So there's all kinds of proposals for managing the allocation and taxation of

934
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:50.420
land-like things that we could try on something like spectrum first,

935
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:54.380
it could be that you have a rolling auction or that you do a self-assessed value

936
00:50:54.381 --> 00:50:55.430
and get tax based on that.

937
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:58.730
There's all kinds of experiments that I think are more palatable there.

938
00:50:58.731 --> 00:51:00.920
And perhaps once we see their value,

939
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.370
where value means like basically you're unlocking a bunch of economic surplus

940
00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.100
and distributing it out to the citizens in some way,

941
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:10.910
then there'll be more eagerness to backport that into physical cities where it's

942
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:11.833
higher risk.

943
00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.920
<v 0>Totally. Everything you said is very exciting to me.</v>

944
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:19.270
I think there have been some experiments run on things like land,

945
00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:22.120
like you're talking about. And for the audience,

946
00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:26.950
I think the way I would characterize things that are like land are things

947
00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:29.140
that you cannot make yourself.

948
00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:32.950
Like you technically can fill and like create islands and stuff.

949
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:37.810
Like basically you can't really make that much land or things that when you use

950
00:51:37.811 --> 00:51:41.710
them, you exclude other people from using them or ruin their experience.

951
00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.470
So for example, if you use a plot of land,

952
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:47.290
someone cannot build on it until you let them.

953
00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:51.580
And so that combination of those two factors of like, you didn't make it.

954
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:53.980
So anytime the value of it goes up,

955
00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.560
you're not responsible for that value of what you're actually going to capture

956
00:51:56.561 --> 00:51:57.394
yourself.

957
00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.700
But then also you're monopolizing it so that the rest of your community cannot

958
00:52:00.881 --> 00:52:02.830
use it. Those are things that are like land.

959
00:52:02.831 --> 00:52:07.420
So anything that's like a natural resource basically falls in this category as

960
00:52:07.421 --> 00:52:10.300
opposed to something like an idea, which is not like land.

961
00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.100
An idea that is like infinitely copyable.

962
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:14.620
<v 2>I think land has this property, furthermore,</v>

963
00:52:14.621 --> 00:52:19.180
where the pure raw land itself gets almost all of its value from the

964
00:52:19.181 --> 00:52:23.380
actions of other people. So like a given acre of land in the United States,

965
00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:25.870
the value of that is almost entirely dependent on where it is.

966
00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:28.600
Therefore the value comes from basically the people around it and all the

967
00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:30.070
activity that's happening.

968
00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.580
So that the reason that totally private ownership of land feels kind of weird

969
00:52:33.581 --> 00:52:36.850
from an economic sense is basically all the value is made by other people,

970
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:38.800
yet all the benefit is accruing to one individual.

971
00:52:38.801 --> 00:52:41.140
And that's not the case for like improved structures in a land, right.

972
00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.260
Which should be treated differently. This reminds me of Georgism,

973
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:49.360
which was the kind of policy prescription to match this worldview about land.

974
00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.280
Devon, you're smiling, maybe you're familiar with this.

975
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:55.540
<v 0>Yeah. I'm a big Henry George nerd. Go on though. I'm very excited about this.</v>

976
00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:55.960
Go ahead.

977
00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.430
<v 2>This was basically his belief about land was that the benefits to the pure raw</v>

978
00:53:00.431 --> 00:53:05.410
land were developed by the citizens of a given polity.

979
00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:07.540
And therefore those benefits were sort of owed to them.

980
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:12.850
So what he advocated was basically you tax the raw value of the land and use

981
00:53:12.851 --> 00:53:16.540
that to fund the government and you don't have income taxes or corporate taxes

982
00:53:16.541 --> 00:53:17.374
or whatever.

983
00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:18.640
<v 0>Yeah. Like concretely,</v>

984
00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:23.620
what that can look like is my parents bought a house in Los Altos about 35,

985
00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:26.760
40 years ago, which is a town San Francisco bay area,

986
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:31.560
which is now a very expensive place to live. They bought it before. I mean,

987
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:34.710
it was already kind of expensive, but now it's like really, really expensive.

988
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:37.320
One of the most like expensive places in the country.

989
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:40.680
And while I love my parents and they're very hardworking people who have

990
00:53:40.681 --> 00:53:42.540
certainly contributed to the community,

991
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:47.130
the vast majority of the increase in that piece of land that they bought decades

992
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:50.310
ago is because a lot of awesome things happened around them.

993
00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:54.810
And people want to buy that land from them so that they can have access to those

994
00:53:54.811 --> 00:53:57.540
awesome things that other people created. Now,

995
00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.570
my parents also remodeled the house, which also increased its value.

996
00:54:00.571 --> 00:54:04.260
So that's something they did. They put a little garden. It's very nice.

997
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:08.640
They themselves were contributing to the community through the work that they

998
00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:12.060
did, the volunteering that they did, you know, they volunteered in my schools,

999
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:17.010
but the reason that property is so darn expensive is because it's where it is.

1000
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.520
And if my parents had done all of that same work and all of that same community

1001
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:24.540
activity in like the middle of rural Missouri or something like that,

1002
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:27.510
their house would not have gained value much at all.

1003
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:32.490
And so that's a situation where they've benefited from the system and, you know,

1004
00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:36.540
indirectly I've benefited too, but it's actually not really just. Like,

1005
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:40.080
that value should actually go back to the community in the form of taxes,

1006
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:40.591
in my opinion.

1007
00:54:40.591 --> 00:54:43.820
<v 2>Yeah. And to bring it back to our discussion about markets,</v>

1008
00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.870
the intuition here shouldn't be that like we should confiscate all the land or

1009
00:54:47.871 --> 00:54:48.620
something, right.

1010
00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:52.910
It's more that we want to bring the dynamism and the distributed information

1011
00:54:52.911 --> 00:54:57.140
processing and the efficiency and the experimentation that you get from markets

1012
00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:00.500
and entrepreneurship, to things that are more shaped like public goods,

1013
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:04.340
or things that impact many people because we have those incredible benefits in

1014
00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:05.420
the pure private markets.

1015
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.330
And it's created an enormous amount of wealth and good in the world, right?

1016
00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:11.420
We've had trouble with the more public domains, which by the way,

1017
00:55:11.421 --> 00:55:15.080
now constitute most of our economy, you know, healthcare, education, so forth.

1018
00:55:15.081 --> 00:55:18.830
We've had trouble with the dynamism and the efficiency in those spaces.

1019
00:55:18.831 --> 00:55:22.580
So if we can find some way to bring those dynamics of the market,

1020
00:55:22.581 --> 00:55:25.100
to these more public spaces, that could be really valuable.

1021
00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:29.180
So thinking about the land thing, if you've ever been a homeowner, you know,

1022
00:55:29.181 --> 00:55:32.780
the incredible amount of pride and attention and care,

1023
00:55:32.781 --> 00:55:35.060
you place in your own private residence, right?

1024
00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.490
Like you pay a lot of attention to it. You're willing to invest in it.

1025
00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:41.870
If we had a mechanism whereby you could get that same sort of care and attention

1026
00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:44.750
to detail on public goods that were impacting others,

1027
00:55:44.751 --> 00:55:46.460
perhaps because you got paid out a dividend or something,

1028
00:55:46.731 --> 00:55:49.310
think of how powerful that could be. You know, how exactly you do it.

1029
00:55:49.311 --> 00:55:50.660
That's the social technology question,

1030
00:55:50.661 --> 00:55:52.670
but I'm optimistic that there's a way to make that happen.

1031
00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:56.420
<v 0>Two ideas I've played around with which might be terrible. You know,</v>

1032
00:55:56.421 --> 00:55:58.160
no one's ever tried them that I know of.

1033
00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:03.500
So the simpler one is what if people in San Francisco had shares in

1034
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:06.470
the city of San Francisco like equity basically.

1035
00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.080
And the reason I ask question is like, right now,

1036
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:12.860
if you're a homeowner in San Francisco and someone builds like a big condo

1037
00:56:12.861 --> 00:56:15.410
building next to you or an office or something, you just lose out,

1038
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.350
like it's just bad. It is actually just kind of bad for you. For the most part,

1039
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:21.950
you know, don't have a nice view. Your vegetable garden has shade.

1040
00:56:21.951 --> 00:56:24.610
Like you have more rowdy neighbors or whatever,

1041
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:27.400
but if you had equity in the city,

1042
00:56:27.401 --> 00:56:30.610
like maybe equity in the property taxes or something like that,

1043
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.090
your incentives would be more aligned with what's good for the community at

1044
00:56:34.091 --> 00:56:38.140
large and what will generate more opportunities for all sorts of people and not

1045
00:56:38.141 --> 00:56:38.974
just yourself.

1046
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:42.130
And so I've always thought that that would be like a really interesting thing

1047
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:46.480
for a city to experiment with. And something like UBI,

1048
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.270
universal basic income, might serve something like that.

1049
00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.840
Though the way that people have talked about universal basic income in the past,

1050
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:55.690
it doesn't tie those two concepts together very well.

1051
00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:58.300
So I don't think people would emotionally get that connection.

1052
00:56:58.301 --> 00:56:59.830
So I'm not sure if that actually solves the problem.

1053
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:02.490
<v 2>Adam stop me before I veer too far off track here,</v>

1054
00:57:02.491 --> 00:57:06.840
but I think it was a tragic mistake to call what we currently call universal

1055
00:57:06.841 --> 00:57:09.870
basic income that instead of something like a citizen's dividend.

1056
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:13.410
It's not like you're entitled to a living by other people's work.

1057
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.760
It's that the work that we all do to build this enormous amount of cultural

1058
00:57:17.761 --> 00:57:20.490
wealth in a given polity, uh, you know,

1059
00:57:20.491 --> 00:57:22.410
that's wealth that we're building for each other.

1060
00:57:22.411 --> 00:57:25.650
And so it's plausible that you would get some dividend of that out to you on a

1061
00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:28.200
per capita basis. And I think that would make a lot more sense,

1062
00:57:28.201 --> 00:57:31.080
like this idea of having shares in San Francisco basically,

1063
00:57:31.081 --> 00:57:34.320
or perhaps you have shares in the properties closest to you on an exponentially

1064
00:57:34.321 --> 00:57:37.020
decaying basis. So the ones right next to you, you own a big chunk of,

1065
00:57:37.021 --> 00:57:39.330
and the ones on the other side of the city, you own almost none of, you know,

1066
00:57:39.331 --> 00:57:41.790
you can imagine all kinds of wild stuff, but I think there's something there.

1067
00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.550
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I think that's an interesting change on it.</v>

1068
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:49.020
And I think like to put some flavor in like the idea of what are people

1069
00:57:49.021 --> 00:57:50.640
contributing to society, cause like, you know,

1070
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:53.640
some people don't do any volunteering. Some people, you know,

1071
00:57:53.641 --> 00:57:55.920
there's some people who don't work at all or whatever, and you're like,

1072
00:57:55.921 --> 00:57:58.680
well maybe they're not contributing, but like just by existing,

1073
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:02.220
maybe you're walking around the street and now a woman who's walking home late

1074
00:58:02.221 --> 00:58:04.290
at night feels safer because you're there, like,

1075
00:58:04.291 --> 00:58:08.100
that's the kind of thing where being around other people actually has value just

1076
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:12.630
purely by itself. And sure everyone contributes slightly different amounts,

1077
00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.020
but right now that's not really recognized at all.

1078
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:19.410
Everyone gets like sort of zero in return, directly.

1079
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:22.170
And I think it would be interesting to like experiment with that.

1080
00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:26.040
I think it would have to be workshopped heavily. So cities,

1081
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:29.430
please don't take this as described, please play with it.

1082
00:58:29.431 --> 00:58:31.650
But I think as a concept, there's something there.

1083
00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:36.270
Another idea is like you could put more markets into the zoning code.

1084
00:58:36.690 --> 00:58:38.280
So instead of saying things like,

1085
00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:43.410
you cannot build buildings higher than this instead you could have like,

1086
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:48.750
have you heard of air rights? So you could have something more like air rights,

1087
00:58:48.751 --> 00:58:52.290
which is basically creating property rights for the air above buildings.

1088
00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.600
In different cities you can like swap them.

1089
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:56.850
<v 1>I mentioned charter cities earlier.</v>

1090
00:58:56.851 --> 00:59:01.800
I was thinking of Astral Codex 10 recently did a kind of review or overview of a

1091
00:59:01.801 --> 00:59:04.980
charter city. And apparently the way they're doing it is what they call voxels,

1092
00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:07.350
which I'm familiar with from my video game days,

1093
00:59:07.351 --> 00:59:08.970
which were essentially 3d pixels.

1094
00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:13.410
So there's one meter by one meter by one meter square voxels and property rights

1095
00:59:13.411 --> 00:59:16.590
are not just sort of the 2d space that's on the ground,

1096
00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:17.840
but actually goes up into the air.

1097
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:20.970
<v 0>Exactly. That's exactly the concept like right.</v>

1098
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.620
We have a very two dimensional property rights system where people like own land

1099
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:27.830
and then some chunk of air above it. But like basically it's 2d,

1100
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:30.800
but there's actually a very massive simplification,

1101
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:35.960
especially in a place like Manhattan or Hong Kong where buildings are extremely

1102
00:59:35.961 --> 00:59:40.370
tall. And so if you could swap those in a more fluid market,

1103
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.480
then I think you would end up with people internalizing more of the

1104
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:47.840
externalities that they impose on people when they have a choice.

1105
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:52.100
So in that example of the Pacific Heights residents,

1106
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:55.160
vegetable garden, they would say, you know what,

1107
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:58.910
it's worth a hundred thousand dollars to me for my vegetable garden,

1108
00:59:58.911 --> 01:00:02.090
not to be overshadowed and I will pay you that money so that you don't do it.

1109
01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:07.520
And now the person who not able to build really high will be compensated for it

1110
01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:10.130
or vice versa. You know, maybe the person trying to build the buildings,

1111
01:00:10.310 --> 01:00:12.320
you know, it's worth a hundred thousand dollars to you,

1112
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:15.590
but it's worth a million dollars to me. So I'm going to do it.

1113
01:00:15.591 --> 01:00:19.640
And now I'm going to compensate you for the cost that has imposed on you.

1114
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:20.480
<v 2>Poor squash.</v>

1115
01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.470
<v 0>Yeah. The poor squash, but it's like very expensive squash.</v>

1116
01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:28.610
And so I think the key idea that this is all trying to get at is like,

1117
01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.520
how can you make it so that when people affect each other,

1118
01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.990
when they have impacts on each other, that that person is compensated for it.

1119
01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:41.000
And so that people actually bear the costs of like that they're imposing on

1120
01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:43.310
other people and if they're willing to pay it, that's great.

1121
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:46.340
But if they're not willing to pay it, then they shouldn't do that action.

1122
01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.470
So anyway, those are still very rough ideas,

1123
01:00:48.471 --> 01:00:52.610
but I think this is why I want to see more cities pop up and exist in the world,

1124
01:00:52.611 --> 01:00:53.420
like Prospera,

1125
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:57.560
the charter city because we'll be able to run these experiments and see if they

1126
01:00:57.561 --> 01:01:00.170
work. And they might be totally crackpot ideas,

1127
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.090
but they also could be great ideas.

1128
01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:06.170
Like democracy seemed like a terrible idea that didn't make any sense for a long

1129
01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:06.501
time,

1130
01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:10.040
but then some countries started experimenting with it and it worked pretty darn

1131
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.710
well. And so more places were able to adopt it.

1132
01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:16.760
And that was only possible because there was a lot of frontier and we don't have

1133
01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:18.950
that much frontier anymore. So we have to make our own.

1134
01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:21.820
<v 1>So maybe before we go,</v>

1135
01:01:21.821 --> 01:01:26.290
I'd love to hear from each of you a city that you think really does a good

1136
01:01:26.650 --> 01:01:28.960
job at being itself, perhaps,

1137
01:01:28.961 --> 01:01:32.740
but in particular that manages to have a unique character and a high quality of

1138
01:01:32.741 --> 01:01:37.720
life and be an attractive place for some certain kind of person or some certain

1139
01:01:37.721 --> 01:01:41.920
industry through good governance through whether it's urban planning,

1140
01:01:41.921 --> 01:01:43.900
whether it's general policymaking,

1141
01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:48.430
as there something that stands out to you as a bit of a role model that others

1142
01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.293
could look to.

1143
01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:54.580
<v 0>The first one that comes to mind for me is Tokyo. It's, I believe,</v>

1144
01:01:54.581 --> 01:01:58.390
the biggest city in the world by population like 37 million people,

1145
01:01:58.391 --> 01:02:00.100
something totally wild.

1146
01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:05.050
And it's a source of roughly all of Japan's economic growth.

1147
01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:05.801
In fact,

1148
01:02:05.801 --> 01:02:09.880
like Japan is a very slow growth country and the population of Japan overall is

1149
01:02:09.881 --> 01:02:12.580
declining, but there's still more people moving to Tokyo,

1150
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.530
which is just an astonishing fact.

1151
01:02:15.010 --> 01:02:18.640
Something I really admire about Tokyo is that they are able to,

1152
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.850
while it's a very desirable place to live,

1153
01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:24.330
the housing costs in Tokyo actually not that high.

1154
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:27.960
And it's not entirely clear to me why this is true.

1155
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.840
There's a number of things that I think contribute to it.

1156
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:36.210
One is that people are pretty liberal about tearing things

1157
01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:37.380
down and building new things.

1158
01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:42.270
And it seems almost like a cultural love of newness and people are always

1159
01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:46.290
excited to like rebuild and create a new thing in a place where an old thing

1160
01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:50.940
stood. And so I think they're able to adjust as things change over time,

1161
01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.210
more rapidly than cities that are more afraid to tear things down.

1162
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:58.920
I think it is sort of cheating in the sense that like Japan overall is seeing

1163
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:03.120
depressed population growth. It is declining. So that does make things cheaper.

1164
01:03:03.390 --> 01:03:06.960
But as I mentioned at the top, like Tokyo is growing as a city.

1165
01:03:06.961 --> 01:03:09.630
The number of people are coming in should balance that out.

1166
01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:14.220
So think Tokyo is one of the few massive cities in the world that has

1167
01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:16.350
maintained a relatively low cost of living.

1168
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.590
And I think that there's a lot of lessons to be learned there and how they've

1169
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:22.560
done it while also being an engine for economic growth.

1170
01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.064
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1171
01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.160
Tokyo is a great choice and there's lots of interesting land use law there.

1172
01:03:28.161 --> 01:03:29.660
We can add some stuff in the show notes,

1173
01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.170
but I think the short version is it's one of the few big cities where it's legal

1174
01:03:33.171 --> 01:03:34.970
to build housing. Therefore it's relatively affordable.

1175
01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.250
<v 0>Yeah. That's a good way to put it.</v>

1176
01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.060
<v 1>I just visited there once a number of years ago, but yeah,</v>

1177
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:45.410
absolutely was impressed by how clean and organized the city was for being the

1178
01:03:45.411 --> 01:03:48.830
world's biggest metropolis. And just as a small note,

1179
01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:52.400
but it's a huge one to me and feels like something every city should adopt.

1180
01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.330
They don't have on street parking. So while there are cars,

1181
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:57.680
each individual street,

1182
01:03:57.681 --> 01:04:02.600
you walk down feels very kind of cozy and human scale in a way that I don't

1183
01:04:02.601 --> 01:04:04.280
associate with basically any other city,

1184
01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:06.950
or I associate with more of a village vibe.

1185
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:11.210
And I think this is just pretty brilliant transit policy and how people get

1186
01:04:11.211 --> 01:04:14.720
around cities and why it's so important that they be able to move conveniently

1187
01:04:14.721 --> 01:04:18.770
and safely is something we didn't get into at all and is a huge interest of

1188
01:04:18.771 --> 01:04:19.460
mine.

1189
01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:24.080
But that's one small example of a policy choice that just radically changes the

1190
01:04:24.081 --> 01:04:24.920
feel of a place.

1191
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:29.330
<v 0>And part of why that's so important is because by not having on-street parking,</v>

1192
01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.020
they're forcing people to internalize externalities that they impose on other

1193
01:04:33.021 --> 01:04:37.310
people. Whereas most American cities have on-street parking and it's free,

1194
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:41.750
which is basically sounds fine, right? Like so many cities have this,

1195
01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:46.520
but the result is that people don't have to pay any of the costs of their car

1196
01:04:46.521 --> 01:04:50.240
taking up space in a city. And so like in San Francisco,

1197
01:04:50.570 --> 01:04:53.630
the square footage of renting out a parking space on the street, it's like,

1198
01:04:53.631 --> 01:04:53.871
I don't know,

1199
01:04:53.871 --> 01:04:57.920
50 cents an hour or something is cheaper than the rent of an actual apartment.

1200
01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.350
And so there have been like people joking,

1201
01:05:00.351 --> 01:05:04.490
like maybe I should just like camp on a parking space all the time and like live

1202
01:05:04.491 --> 01:05:07.670
there because it'll be cheaper than renting an apartment. And it's effectively,

1203
01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:10.730
there's like public space that we've given up to people and said like,

1204
01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:14.390
you can have this and do whatever you want with it without realizing that you're

1205
01:05:14.391 --> 01:05:16.160
implicitly making a trade-off. And so, yeah,

1206
01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:19.060
I really love that Japan and Tokyo does that.

1207
01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.140
<v 2>The parking topic is its whole own interesting thing.</v>

1208
01:05:22.141 --> 01:05:24.900
I very highly recommend the book The High Cost of Free Parking.

1209
01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:29.640
It's an economic and mathematical analysis of what happens when you give away,

1210
01:05:29.641 --> 01:05:30.750
or subsidize, parking.

1211
01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.800
And the short version is that every free spot in a major city is like lighting

1212
01:05:34.801 --> 01:05:37.650
tens of thousands of dollars on fire. You can read the book for the details.

1213
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:39.660
<v 0>It's a great book. It's really good.</v>

1214
01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.320
<v 1>So I think for me, my choice will be Dubai,</v>

1215
01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:47.670
which we mentioned briefly earlier. And in fact, I've never been there,

1216
01:05:47.671 --> 01:05:50.610
but I've read a couple of pretty good books about it,

1217
01:05:50.611 --> 01:05:52.530
including The History of Future Cities,

1218
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:55.800
which covers a few very interesting cities, such as St.

1219
01:05:55.801 --> 01:05:57.570
Petersburg and some others.

1220
01:05:57.571 --> 01:06:02.130
And then another one that's sort of a longer history of the ruling class there

1221
01:06:02.131 --> 01:06:04.440
and how Dubai came to be. And on one hand,

1222
01:06:04.441 --> 01:06:08.040
it's an amazing example of human achievement and what you can do if you decide

1223
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:08.641
you want to,

1224
01:06:08.641 --> 01:06:11.280
and while you have a lot of resources to throw at it on the other hand,

1225
01:06:11.281 --> 01:06:15.690
there's a lot there that's extremely terrible. So it is this study in contrasts,

1226
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:19.680
but I guess I don't necessarily take it as that it reflects a place I want to

1227
01:06:19.681 --> 01:06:21.840
live or as how we should build cities,

1228
01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.790
but rather you get this sense that it is

1229
01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:27.361
possible.

1230
01:06:27.361 --> 01:06:32.160
We can decide as kind of societies that we want to build a

1231
01:06:32.161 --> 01:06:34.890
city in a particular way, and we want it to be a particular way.

1232
01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:38.490
And coming back to that kind of let a thousand flowers bloom,

1233
01:06:38.491 --> 01:06:40.650
we need to experiment more to me,

1234
01:06:40.651 --> 01:06:45.450
it's sort of inspiring in its study in contrasts. And for me,

1235
01:06:45.451 --> 01:06:50.130
it sort of opened my eyes to what could we do if we were willing to think a

1236
01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:52.230
little bit more outside of the box about our cities.

1237
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:55.650
<v 2>And the ones I'll pick are not perfect by any means.</v>

1238
01:06:55.651 --> 01:06:57.690
But I think they're very interesting and important.

1239
01:06:57.691 --> 01:07:02.550
And those are the major cities in Texas like Austin and Houston. Texas cities,

1240
01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:05.730
perhaps more than any other in the Western world,

1241
01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:09.150
embrace the idea of let people do things and see what happens.

1242
01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:13.110
So if you've ever visited one of these cities in Texas, it's highly chaotic.

1243
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.750
There's incredible amounts of cars and freeways everywhere.

1244
01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.840
There's like houses next to commercial and next to light industrial,

1245
01:07:18.841 --> 01:07:22.200
it's kind of anything goes and they're constantly building stuff and tearing

1246
01:07:22.201 --> 01:07:23.034
stuff down.

1247
01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.030
But the result is that you get this incredible dynamism and indeed people are

1248
01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:28.560
voting with their feet to move to Texas.

1249
01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:30.600
So I think it's at least a very interesting experiment.

1250
01:07:30.601 --> 01:07:33.150
And I'll be curious to see how it plays out over the next couple of decades.

1251
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:38.330
<v 1>Well, let's wrap it there. Thanks everyone for listening. If you have feedback,</v>

1254
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:52.430
whenever you get around to starting your charter city and implementing all of

1255
01:07:52.431 --> 01:07:56.180
your unique ideas, please let me know. I can't promise I'll move there,

1256
01:07:56.181 --> 01:07:57.230
but at least I want to visit.

1257
01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:00.480
<v 0>I'll definitely keep you posted. Thanks so much for having me.</v>
