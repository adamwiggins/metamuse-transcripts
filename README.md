# Metamuse Transcripts

This project hosts transcripts for [Metamuse](https://museapp.com/podcast/), a podcast about tools for thought, product design, and how to have good ideas, from the team behind [Muse](https://museapp.com/).

## Structure

## Methodology
After trying a couple of homegrown approaches, I landed on using [Rev](https://rev.com/) to get the original transcripts and I'm using their online editor as well to fix things. I'm keeping files up here so people can open pull requests to fix any errors they find in the transcripts.
