# Contributing to Transcripts

:bow: Thanks for considering contributing. This is a big project for anyone to do alone so any help is appreciated! :bow:

This process is still in its infancy so expect it to be a little rough at first.

## New Transcripts

Hold on to your butts. This is the most helpful but also the most labor intensive way to contribute. There are a bunch of transcripts that need a "first pass." The automated transcription does a good job, but doesn't quite meet the quality standards.

1. Find an issue the the label [up for grabs](https://github.com/ppkn/metamuse-transcripts/labels/up%20for%20grabs) and comment that you want to work on it. I'll remove the label when I see the comment.
2. Copy the episode file from `originals/` to `plaintext/`.
3. When you feel comfortable with the first pass you've made, open a pull request. [Helpful article for first-timers](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
4. Your MR will be reviewed and merged into the main branch.

## Corrections

Have you noticed an existing problem with an episode transcript? Here's how you can help.

1. Edit the corresponding file in `plaintext/`
2. Open a pull request of the changes.
3. Your MR will be reviewed and merged into the main branch.
